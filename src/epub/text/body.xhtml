<h2>Chapter I. <br/> The Euthanasia Policy</h2>

<p>The principles of insurance, they tell us, were
not hidden from our Anglo-Saxon forefathers.
How anybody had the enterprise in
those rough-and-tumble days to guarantee a client
against “fire, water, robbery or other calamity”
remains a problem for the historian; the more so as it
appears that mathematical calculations were first
applied to the business by the eminent John de Witt.
In our own time, at any rate, the insurance
companies have woven a golden net under the tight-rope
walk of existence; if life is a lottery, the prudent
citizen faces it with the consciousness that he is backed
both ways. Had the idea been thoroughly grasped in
those remoter periods, no doubt but Alfred’s hostess
would have been easily consoled for the damage done
to her cakes and King John handsomely compensated
for all that he lost in The Wash. Let us thank
the soaring genius of the human mind which has thus
found a means to canalize for us the waters of
affliction; and let us always be scrupulous in paying up
our premiums before the date indicated on the
printed card, lest calamity should come upon us and
find us unprepared.</p>

<p>In a sense, though, insurance was but an empirical
science until the Indescribable Company made its
appearance. The man who is insured with the
Indescribable walks the world in armour of proof; those
contrary accidents and mortifications which are a
source of spiritual profit to the saint are a source of
material advantage to him. No east wind but flatters
him with the prospect of a lucrative cold; no dropped
banana skin but may suddenly hurl him into
affluence. The chicken-farmer whose hen-houses are
fitted with the company’s patent automatic egg-register
can never make a failure of his business. The
egg is no sooner laid than it falls gently through a
slot which marks its passage on a kind of taximeter;
and if the total of eggs at the end of the month is
below the average the company pays—I had almost
said, the company lays—an exact monetary equivalent
for the shortage. The company which thus takes
upon itself the office of a hen is equally ready when
occasion arises to masquerade as a bee: if your hives
are opened in the presence of its representative you
can distend every empty cell with sweet nectar at
the company’s expense. Doctors can guarantee themselves
against an excess of panel patients, barristers
against an absence of briefs. You can insure every
step you take on this side of the grave, but no one
of them on such handsome terms as the step which
takes you into the grave; and it is confidently
believed that if certain practical difficulties could be
got over the Indescribable would somehow contrive
to frank your passage into the world beyond. Wags
have made merry at the company’s expense, alleging
that a burglar can insure himself against a haul of
sham jewels, and a clergyman against insufficient
attendance at even-song. They tell stories of a client
who murmured “Thank God!” as he fell down a
lift-shaft, and a shipwrecked passenger who manifested
the liveliest annoyance at the promptness of his
rescuers when he was being paid for floating on a
life-belt at the rate of ten pounds a minute. So thoroughly
has the Indescribable reversed our scale of values
here below.</p>

<p>But of all the company’s enterprises none can rival
in importance or in popularity the so-called
Euthanasia policy. One of the giant brains that organized
the undertaking observed with compassion the
doubtful lot of human kind, the lot which makes the
business man sweat and labour and agonize, uncertain
whether he himself will reap the fruits of his industry
or whether they will pass to an heir in whom, on the
whole, he is less interested. It follows, of course, from
the actuarial point of view, that he needs a policy
which covers both possibilities, immature death or
unexpected longevity, but the former on a more
princely scale than the latter. If you take out a
Euthanasia policy you will pay very heavy
premiums; that goes without saying. But you pay them
with a sense of absolute security. If you should die
before the age of sixty-five a fortune is immediately
distributed to your heirs and assigns. If you outlive
that crucial age you become thenceforward, until the
decree of nature takes its tardy effect, the pensioner
of the company; every faltering breath you draw in
the last stages of senility is money to you; your heirs
and assigns, instead of looking forward heartlessly
to the moment of your release, conspire to keep your
body and soul together with every known artifice of
modern medicine—it is in their interest to do so.
There is but one way in which you can forfeit the
manifest advantages of the scheme, and that is
self-murder. So complex is our human fashioning that
men even may be tempted to enrich their surviving
relatives by such means; and you will find,
accordingly, at the bottom of your Euthanasia policy, an
ominous black hand directing attention to the fact
that in the event of suicide no benefits are legally
recoverable.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the Indescribable
Building is among the finest in London. It appears to
be an axiom with those who conduct business in the
modern, or American, manner that efficiency is
impossible unless all your transactions are conducted
in an edifice not much smaller and not much less
elaborate than the Taj Mahal. Why this should be so
it is difficult to explain. In a less credulous age we
might have been tempted to wonder where all the
money came from; whether (to put it brutally) our
premiums might not have worked out a little lower
if the company’s premises had not been quite so high.
After all, our solicitor lives in horrid, dingy little
chambers, with worn-out carpets and immemorial
cobwebs on the wall—does he never feel that this
squalor will fail to inspire confidence? Apparently
not; yet the modern insurance company must
impress us all through the palatial splendour of its
offices with the idea that there is a vast reserve of
capital behind it. The wildest voluptuousness of an
Eastern tyrant is less magnificent in its architectural
scheme than the hard-headed efficiency of the
American business man. Chatting in the waiting-room of
some such edifice, Sardanapalus might have protested
that it stumped him how they did it, and Kublai
Khan might have registered the complaint that it
was all very well but the place didn’t feel homey.</p>

<p>Indescribable House is an enormously high
building with long, narrow windows that make it look like
an Egyptian tomb. It is of white stone, of course, so
time-defying in its appearance that it seems almost
blasphemous to remember the days when it was
simply a gigantic shell composed of iron girders. Over
the front door there is a group of figures in relief,
more than life-size; the subject is intended, I believe,
to be Munificence wiping away the tears of
Widowhood, though the profane have identified it before
now as Uncle Sam picking Britannia’s pocket. This
is continued all round the four sides by a frieze,
ingeniously calculated to remind the spectator of the
numerous risks which mortality has to run: here a
motor accident, with an ambulance carrying off the
injured parties; here an unmistakable shipwreck;
there a big-game hunter being gored by a
determined-looking buffalo, while a lion prowls thoughtfully in
the background. Of the interior I cannot speak so
positively, for even those who are favoured enough
to be the company’s clients never seem to go up
beyond the first storey. But rumour insists that there
is a billiard-room for the convenience of the directors
(who never go there); and that from an aeroplane,
in hot weather, you can see the clerks playing tennis
on the roof. What they do when they are not playing
tennis and what possible use there can be in all those
multitudinous rooms on the fifth, sixth and seventh
floors are thoughts that paralyze the imagination.</p>

<p>In one of the waiting-rooms on the ground floor,
sitting under a large palm-tree and reading a closely
reasoned article in the <i>Actuaries’ and Bottomry
Gazette</i>, sat a client to whom the reader will do well to
direct attention, for our story is concerned with him.
His look, his dress, his manner betrayed the rich
man only to those who have frequented the smaller
provincial towns and know how little in those
centres money has to do with education. He had a short
black coat with very broad and long lapels, a starched
collar that hesitated between the Shakespeare and
the all-the-way-and-back-again patterns, a
double-breasted waistcoat from which hung a variety of
seals, lockets and charms—in London, in fact, you
would have put him down for an old-fashioned bank
cashier with a moderate income. Actually, he could
have bought you out of your present job at double the
salary and hardly felt it. In Pullford, a large
Midland town which you probably will never visit, men
nudged one another and pointed to him as one of the
wealthiest residents. In the anteroom of the
Indescribable offices he looked, and perhaps felt, like a
schoolboy waiting his turn for pocket-money. Yet
even here he was a figure recognizable to the
attendant who stood there smoothing out back numbers of
the <i>Actuaries’ and Bottomry Gazette</i>. For this man,
called Mottram by accident of birth and Jephthah
through the bad taste of his parents, was the holder
of a Euthanasia policy.</p>

<p>Another attendant approached him, summoning
him to his appointed interview. There was none of
that “Mr. Mottram, please!” which reverberates so
grimly through the dentist’s waiting-room. At the
Indescribable the attendants come close to you and
beckon you away with confidential whispers; it is
part of the tradition. Mr. Mottram rose, and was
gently sucked up by the lift to the first storey,
where fresh attendants ushered him on into one of
the few rooms that really mattered. Here he was met
by a pleasant, rather languid young man, delicately
dressed, university-bred, whose position in the
complicated hierarchy of the Indescribable it is no
business of ours to determine.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Mottram? Keeping well, I
hope?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mottram had the blunt manner of his fellow
townsmen, and did not appreciate the finesse of
metropolitan conversational openings. “Ah, that’s
right,” he said; “best for you I should keep well, eh?
You and I won’t quarrel there. Well, it may surprise
you, but it’s my health I’ve come to talk about. I
don’t look ill, do I?”</p>

<p>“You look fit for anything. I’d sooner be your
insurance agent than your family doctor, Mr.
Mottram.” The young man was beginning to pick up the
Pullford idea of light small talk.</p>

<p>“Fit for anything, that’s right. And, mind you, I
feel fit for anything. Never felt better. Two years!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“Two years, that’s what he says. What’s the good
of being able to know about these things if they can’t
do anything <em>for</em> ’em, that’s what I want to know?
And, mind you, he says there isn’t anything for it,
not in the long run. He tells me to take this and that,
you know, and give up this and that”——</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Mottram, but I don’t quite
understand. Is this your doctor you’re talking about?”</p>

<p>“No doctor of mine. My doctor down in Pullford,
he couldn’t tell what was the matter. Sent me on to
this big man in London I’ve been seeing this
morning. Two years, he says. Seems hard, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! . . . You’ve been to a specialist. I say, I’m
most awfully sorry.” The young man was quite
serious in his condolences, though he was even more
embarrassed than actually grieved. It seemed horrible
to him that this red-faced man who looked so well
and obviously enjoyed his meals should be going
where Numa and Ancus went before him: he did not
fit into the picture. No taint of professionalism
entered into this immediate reaction. But Mr. Mottram
still took the business line.</p>

<p>“Ah! ‘sorry’—you may say that. It may mean half
a million to you, mayn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, look here, these specialists are often
wrong. Famous case of one who went potty and told
all his patients they were in for it. Look here, what
about seeing our man? He’d vet you, gladly.”</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the Indescribable keeps
its own private physician, whose verdict must be
obtained before any important insurance is effected.
He is considered to be one of the three best doctors
in England, and fantastic stories are told about the
retaining fee which induced him to give up his
practice in Harley Street. Once more the young man was
entirely disinterested; once more Mr. Mottram saw
ground for suspicion. It looked to him as if the
company were determined to get stable information
about the exact state of his health, and he did not
like the idea.</p>

<p>“It’s of no consequence, thank you all the same.
It isn’t as if my case were a doubtful one; I can give
you the doctor’s certificate if needed. But I didn’t
come here to talk about that; I came on business.
You know how I stand?”</p>

<p>The young man had just been looking up Mr.
Mottram’s docket and knew all about him well enough.
But the Indescribable cultivates the family touch; it
likes to treat its clients as man to man, not as so
many <em>lives</em>. “Let’s see”—the young man appeared
to be dragging the depths of memory—“you should
be sixty-three now, eh? And in two years’ time—why,
it looks as if it were just touch and go whether
your policy covered a case of—h’m!—premature
decease or not, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. My birthday’s in a fortnight’s time,
more or less. If that doctor was dead accurate, it’ll
stand you in five hundred thousand; if he put the
date a bit too soon, then I get nothing, and you pay
nothing; that’s how it is, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it, I’m afraid. Of course, you’ll
understand, Mr. Mottram, the company has to work by
rule of thumb in these cases.”</p>

<p>“I see that. But look at it this way. When I took
out that policy I wasn’t thinking much of the
insurance part; I’ve no kith nor kin except one nephew,
and he’s seen fit to quarrel with me, so nothing goes
to him, anyhow. If that half-million falls in, it will
just go to charity. But what I’d set my heart on was
the annuity; we’re a long-lived family, mostly, and
I’d looked forward to spending my last days in
comfort, d’you see? Well, there’s no chance of that after
what the doctor’s been telling me. So I don’t value
that Youth-in-Asia policy as much as I did, see?
And I’ve come here to make you a fair offer.”</p>

<p>“The company”—— began the young man.</p>

<p>“Let me have my say, and you shall have yours
afterward. They call me rich, and I suppose I am
rich; but my stuff is tied up more than you’d think;
with money as tight as it is, you can’t just sell out of
a thing when you feel inclined. What I want is ready
money—doctors’ bills, you know, and foreign travel,
and treatment, and that. So this is my offer: you pay
back half the premiums from the time I started
insuring with you, half the premiums, mind you; and
if I die before I reach sixty-five, then we call it off;
you pay no insurance: if I live beyond sixty-five we
call it off, and you pay no annuity. Come now, there’s
a business offer. What do you people say to it?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; I’m frightfully sorry. But, you know,
we’ve had this kind of offer before, and the company
has always taken the line that it can’t go back on the
original contract. If we lose, we lose; if the client
loses, he must shoulder the responsibility. If we once
went in for cancelling our insurances like that, our
whole credit would suffer. I know you mean well by
us, Mr. Mottram, and we’re grateful to you for the
generosity of the offer; but it can’t be done; really it
can’t.”</p>

<p>There was a heavy silence for nearly a minute.
Then Mr. Mottram, pathetic in his disappointment,
tried his last card.</p>

<p>“You could put it to the directors, couldn’t you?
Stands to reason you couldn’t accept an offer of that
kind without referring it to them. But you could put
it to them at their next meeting, eh?”</p>

<p>“I could put it to the directors; indeed, I will.
But I’m sorry to say I can’t hold out any hopes. The
premium of the Euthanasia policy is so stiff that
we’re always having people wanting to back out of it
half-way, but the directors have never consented.
If you take my advice, Mr. Mottram, you’ll take a
second opinion about your health, go carefully this
next year or two, and live to enjoy that annuity—for
many years, I hope.” The young man, after all, was
a paid official; he did not stand to lose.</p>

<p>Mr. Mottram rose; he declined all offers of
refreshment. A little wearily, yet holding his head high,
he let the confidential attendants usher him out. The
young man made some notes, and the grim business
of the Indescribable Company went on. In distant
places ships were foundering, factories were being
struck by lightning, crops were being spoiled by
blight, savages were raiding the peaceful
country-side; men were lying on air-cushions, fighting for
breath in the last struggle of all. And to the
Indescribable Company all these things meant business;
most of them meant loss. But the loss never
threatened its solvency for a moment; the law of averages
saw to that.</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br/> The Detective <i>Malgré Lui</i></h2>

<p>I have already mentioned that the Indescribable
kept its own tame doctor, a man at the very
head of his profession. He was not in the least
necessary to it; that is to say, a far cheaper man
would have done the work equally well. But it suited
the style of the Indescribable to have the very best
man, and to advertise the fact that he had given up
his practice in order to work exclusively for the
company; it was all of a piece with the huge white
building, and the frieze, and the palms in the
waiting-room. It looked well. For a quite different reason the
Indescribable retained its own private detective. This
fact was not advertised; nor was he ever referred to
in the official communications of the company except
as “our representative.” He carried neither a lens nor
a forceps—not even a revolver; he took no
injections; he had no stupid confidential friend; but a
private detective he was for all that. An amateur
detective I will not call him, for the company paid him,
and as you would expect, quite handsomely; but he
had nothing whatever to do with Scotland Yard,
where the umbrellas go to.</p>

<p>He was not an ornament to the company; he
fulfilled a quite practical purpose. There are, even
outside the humorous stories, business men in a small
way who find it more lucrative to burn down their
premises than to sell their stock. There are
ladies—ladies whose names the Indescribable would never
dream of giving away—who pawn their jewels, buy
sham ones, and then try to make the original
insurance policy cover them in the event of theft. There
are small companies (believe it or not) which declare
an annual loss by selling their stuff below cost price
to themselves under another name. Such people
flocked to the Indescribable. It was so vast a
concern that you felt no human pity about robbing
it—it was like cheating the income tax, and we all know
how some people feel about that. The Indescribable
never prosecuted for fraud; instead, it allowed a
substantial margin for these depredations, which it
allowed to continue. But where shady work was
suspected “our representative” would drop in in the
most natural way in the world and by dint of some
searching inquiries made while the delinquent’s back
was turned would occasionally succeed in showing up
a fraud and saving the company a few hundreds of
thousands by doing so.</p>

<p>The company’s “representative,” and our hero,
was Miles Bredon, a big, good-humoured, slightly
lethargic creature still in the early thirties. His father
had been a lawyer of moderate eminence and success.
When Miles went to school it was quite clear that he
would have to make his own way in the world, and
very obscure how he was going to do it. He was not
exactly lazy, but he was the victim of hobbies
which perpetually diverted his attention. He was a
really good mathematician, for example; but as he
never left a sum unfinished and “went on to the next”
his marks never did him justice. He was a good
cross-country runner, but in the middle of a run he would
usually catch sight of some distraction which made
him wander three miles out of his course and come
in last. It was his nature to be in love with the next
thing he had to do, to shrink in loathing from the
mere thought of the next but one. The war came
in time to solve the problem of his career; and more
fortunate than some he managed to hit on a <i>métier</i>
in the course of it. He became an intelligence
officer; did well, then did brilliantly; was mentioned
in despatches, though not decorated. What was more
to the point, his Colonel happened to be a friend of
some minor director of the Indescribable, and,
hearing that a discreet man was needed to undertake
the duties outlined, recommended Bredon. The offer
fell at his feet just when he was demobilized; he
hated the idea of it, but was sensible enough to
realize, even then, that ex-officers cannot be choosers.
He was accepted on his own terms, namely, that he
should not have to sit in an office kicking his heels;
he would always be at home, and the company might
call him in when he was wanted.</p>

<p>In a few years he had made himself indispensable
to his employer; that is to say, they thought they
could not get on without him, though in fact his
application to his duties was uncertain and desultory.
Four out of five inquiries meant nothing to him;
he made nothing of them; and Whitechapel thanked
the God of its fathers for his incompetence. The
fifth case would appeal to his capricious imagination;
he would be prodigal of time and of pains; and he
would bring off some coup which was hymned for
weeks behind closed doors in the Indescribable
Building. There was that young fellow at Croydon,
for example, who had his motor-bicycle insured, but
not his mother-in-law. Her body was found at the
foot of an embankment beside a lonely road in Kent,
and there was no doubt that it had been shot out of
the side-car; only (as Bredon managed to prove)
the lady’s death had occurred on the previous day
from natural causes. There was the well-known
bootlegger—well known, at least, to the United States
police—who insured all his cargoes with the
Indescribable and then laid secret information against
himself whereby vigilant officials sank hundreds of
dummy cases in the sea, all the bottles containing
sea-water. And there was the lady of fashion who
burgled her own jewels in the most plausible manner
you could imagine and had them sold in Paris.
These crooked ways too the fitful intuitions of Miles
Bredon made plain in the proper quarters.</p>

<p>He was well thought of, in fact, by every one
except himself. For himself, he bitterly regretted the
necessity that had made him become a spy—he
would use no other word for it—and constantly
alarmed his friends by announcing his intention of
going into the publishing trade, or doing something
relatively honest. The influence which saved him
on these occasions was that of—how shall I say
it?—his wife. I know—I know it is quite wrong to
have your detective married until the last chapter,
but it is not my fault. It is the fault of two mocking
eyes and two very capable hands that were employed
in driving brass-hats to and fro in London at the
end of the war. Bredon surrendered to these, and
made a hasty but singularly fortunate marriage.
Angela Bredon was under no illusions about the
splendid figure in khaki that stood beside her at
the altar. Wiser than her generation, she realized
that marriages were not “for the duration”; that she
would have to spend the rest of her life with a large,
untidy, absent-minded man who would frequently
forget that she was in the room. She saw that he
needed above all things a nurse and a chauffeur, and
she knew that she could supply both these
deficiencies admirably. She took him as a husband, with
all a husband’s failings, and the Indescribable itself
could not have guaranteed her more surely against
the future.</p>

<p>There is a story of some Bishop, or important
person, who got his way at Rome rather unexpectedly
over an appeal, and, when asked by his friends how
he did it, replied, “<i>Fallendo infallibilem</i>.” It might
have been the motto of Angela’s mastery over her
husband; the detective, always awake to the
possibilities of fraudulent dealing in every other
human creature, did not realize that his wife was a tiny
bit cleverer than he was and was always conspiring
for his happiness behind his back. For instance, it
was his custom of an evening to play a very long
and complicated game of patience, which he had
invented for himself; you had to use four packs,
and the possible permutations of it were almost
unlimited. It was an understood thing in the
household that Angela, although she had grasped the rules
of the game, did not really know how to play it. But
when, as often happened, the unfinished game had to
be left undisturbed all night, she was quite capable
of stealing down early in the morning and altering
the positions of one or two cards, so that he should
get the game “out” in time to cope with his ordinary
work. These pious deceits of hers were never, I am
glad to say, unmasked.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Mr. Mottram’s interview
with the young man at Indescribable House these
two fortunate people were alone together after
dinner, she alternately darning socks and scratching
the back of a sentimental-looking fox-terrier, he
playing his interminable patience. The bulk of the
pack lay on a wide table in front of him, but there
were outlying sections of the design dotted here and
there on the floor within reach of his hand. The
telephone bell rang, and he looked up at her
appealingly—obviously, he was tied hand and foot by his
occupation—which to her only meant putting her
darning away, lifting the fox-terrier off her feet, and
going out into the hall. She understood the signal,
and obeyed it. There was a fixed law of the
household that if she answered a call which was meant
for him he must try to guess what it was about
before she told him. This was good for him, she said;
it developed the sleuth instinct.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Mrs. Bredon speaking—who is it, please? . . .
Oh, it’s you. . . . Yes, he’s in, but he’s not
answering the telephone. . . . No, only drunk. . . .
Just rather drunk. . . . Business? Good; that’s just
what he wants. . . . A man called what? . . .
M-o-t-t-r-a-m, Mottram, yes. . . . Never heard of
it. . . . St. William’s? Oh, the <em>Midlands</em>, that are
sodden and unkind, that sort of Midlands, yes? . . .
Oh! . . . Is it—what? . . . Is it supposed to have
been an accident? . . . Oh, that generally means
suicide, doesn’t it? . . . Staying where? . . . Where’s
that? . . . All right, doesn’t matter; I’ll look it
up. . . . At an inn? Oh, then it was in somebody else’s
bed really! What name? . . . What a jolly name!
Well, where’s Miles to go? To Chilthorpe? . . .
Yes, rather, we can start bright and early. Is it an
important case? Is it an important case? . . . Oo!
I say! I wish I could get Miles to die and leave me
half a million! Righto, he’ll wire you to-morrow. . . .
Yes, quite; thanks. . . . Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Interpret, please,” said Angela, returning to the
drawing-room. “Why, you’ve been going on with
your patience the whole time! I suppose you didn’t
listen to a word I was saying?”</p>

<p>“How often am I to tell you that the memory and
the attention function inversely? I remember all you
said, precisely because I wasn’t paying attention to
it. First of all, it was Sholto, because he was ringing
you up on business, but it was somebody you know
quite well—at least I hope you don’t talk like that
to the tradesmen.”</p>

<p>“Sholto, yes, ringing up from the office. He wanted
to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“So I gathered. Was it quite necessary to tell him
I was drunk?”</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t think of anything else to say
at the moment. I couldn’t tell him you were
playing patience, or he might have thought we were
unhappily married. Go on, Sherlock.”</p>

<p>“Mottram, living at some place in the Midlands
you’ve never heard of, but staying at a place called
‘Chilthorpe’—he’s died, and his death wants
investigating; that’s obvious.”</p>

<p>“How did you know he was dead?”</p>

<p>“From the way you said ‘Oh’—besides, you said
he’d died in his bed, or implied it. And there’s some
question of half a million insurance—Euthanasia,
I suppose? Really, the Euthanasia’s been responsible
for more crimes than psychoanalysis.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid you’ve got it all right. What did
he die of?”</p>

<p>“Something that generally means suicide—or
rather, you think it does. The old sleeping draught
business? Veronal?”</p>

<p>“No stupid, gas. The gas left turned on. And
where’s Chilthorpe, please?”</p>

<p>“It’s on the railway. If my memory serves me
right, it is Chilthorpe and Gorrington, between Bull’s
Cross and Lowgill Junction. But the man, you say,
belongs somewhere else?”</p>

<p>“Pullford; at least it sounded like that. In the
Midlands somewhere, he said.”</p>

<p>“Pullford, good Lord, yes. One of these frightful
holes. They make perambulators or something there,
don’t they? A day’s run, I should think, in the car.
But of course it’s this Chilthorpe place we want to
get to. You wouldn’t like to look it up in the
gazetteer while I just get this row finished, would you?”</p>

<p>“I shan’t get your sock finished, then. On your
own foot be it! Let’s see, here’s Pullford all
right. . . . It isn’t perambulators they make, it’s
drain-pipes. There’s a grammar school there, and an
asylum; and the parish church is a fine specimen of early
Perp., extensively restored in 1842; they always are.
Has been the seat of a Roman Catholic Bishopric
since 1850. The Baptist Chapel”——</p>

<p>“I did mention, didn’t I, that it was Chilthorpe I
wanted to know about?”</p>

<p>“All in good time. Let’s see, Chilthorpe—it isn’t
a village really, it’s a ship town. It has 2,500
inhabitants. There’s a lot here about the glebe. It
stands on the River Busk, and there is trout fishing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that sounds better.”</p>

<p>“Meaning exactly?”</p>

<p>“Well, it sounds as if the fellow had done himself
in by accident all right. He went there to fish—you
don’t go to a strange village to commit suicide.”</p>

<p>“Unless you’ve got electric light in your house and
want to commit suicide with gas.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. What was the name of the inn, by
the way?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Load of Mischief</i>. Such a jolly dedication, I
think.”</p>

<p>“Now let’s try the map.”</p>

<p>“I was coming to that. Here’s the Busk all right.
I say, how funny, there’s a place on the Busk called
‘Mottram.’ ”</p>

<p>“Anywhere near Chilthorpe?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t found it yet. Oh, yes, here it is, about
four miles away. Incidentally, it’s only twenty miles
or so from Pullford. Well, what about it? Are we
going by car?”</p>

<p>“Why not? The Rolls is in excellent condition.
Two or three days ought to see us through; we can
stay, with any luck, at the <i>Load of Mischief</i>, and
the youthful Francis will be all the better for being
left to his nurse for a day or two. You’ve been
feeding him corn, and he is becoming obstreperous.”</p>

<p>“You don’t deserve to have a son. However, I
think you’re right. I don’t want to trust you alone
in a ship town of 2,500 inhabitants, some of them
female. Miles, dear, this is going to be one of your
big successes, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I shall lose no time in reporting
to the directors that the deceased gentleman had an
unfortunate accident with the gas, and they had
better pay up like sportsmen. I shall further point out
that it is a great waste of their money keeping a
private spy at all.”</p>

<p>“Good, then I’ll divorce you! I’m going to bed
now. Not beyond the end of that second row, mind;
we shall have to make an early start to-morrow.”</p>

<h2>Chapter III. <br/> At the <i>Load of Mischief</i></h2>

<p>By next morning Bredon’s spirits had risen.
He had received by the early post a
confidential letter from the company describing
Mr. Mottram’s curious offer, and suggesting
(naturally) that the state of his health made suicide a
plausible conjecture. The morning was fine, the car
running well, the road they had selected in admirable
condition. It was still before tea time when they
turned off from its excellent surface onto indifferent
by-roads, through which they had to thread their
way with difficulty. The signposts, as is the wont of
English signposts, now blazoned “Chilthorpe,”
“Chilthorpe,” “Chilthorpe,” as if it were the
lodestone of the neighbourhood, now passed it over in
severe silence, preferring to call attention to the
fact that you were within five furlongs of Little
Stubley. They had fallen, besides, upon hill
country, with unexpected turns and precipitous gradients;
they followed with enforced windings the bleak
valley of the Busk, which swirled beneath them over
smooth boulders between desolate banks. It was
just after they had refused the fifth invitation to
Little Stubley that the County Council’s
arrangements played them false; there was a clear issue
between two rival roads, with no trace of a
signpost to direct their preference. It was here that they
saw, and hailed, an old gentleman who was making
casts into a promising pool about twenty yards away.</p>

<p>“Chilthorpe?” said the old gentleman. “All the
world seems to be coming to Chilthorpe. The County
Council does not appear to have allowed for the
possibility of its becoming such a centre of fashion. If
you are fond of scenery, you should take the road to
the left; it goes over the hill. If you like your tea
weak, you had better take the valley road to the
right. Five o’clock is tea time at the <i>Load of
Mischief</i>, and there is no second brew.”</p>

<p>Something in the old gentleman’s tone seemed to
invite confidences. “Thank you very much,” said
Bredon. “I suppose the <i>Load of Mischief</i> is the only
inn that one can stop at?”</p>

<p>“There was never much to be said for the <i>Swan</i>.
But to-day the <i>Load of Mischief</i> has added to its
attractions; it is not everywhere you can sleep with
the corpse of a suicide in the next room. And the
police are in the house, to satisfy the most morbid
imagination.”</p>

<p>“The police? When did they come?”</p>

<p>“About luncheon time. They are understood to
have a clue. I am only afraid, myself, that they
will want to drag the river. The police always drag
the river if they can think of nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>“You’re staying at the inn, I gather?”</p>

<p>“I am the surviving guest. When you have tasted
the coffee in the morning you will understand the
temptation to suicide; but so far I have resisted it.
You are not relatives, I hope, of the deceased?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m from the Indescribable. We insured him,
you know.”</p>

<p>“It must be a privilege to die under such auspices.
But I am afraid I have gone beyond my book: when
I say poor Mottram committed suicide I am giving
you theory not fact.”</p>

<p>“The police theory?”</p>

<p>“Hardly. I left before they arrived. It is the
landlady’s theory, and when you know her better you
will know that it is as well not to disagree with her;
it provokes discussion.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid she must be very much worried by
all this.”</p>

<p>“She is in the seventh heaven of lamentation. You
could knock her down, she tells me, with a feather.
She insists that her custom is ruined for ever;
actually, you are the second party to stay at the inn
as the result of this affair, and the jug and bottle
business at mid-day was something incredible. The
Band of Hope was there <i>en masse</i>, swilling beer in
the hope of picking up some gossip.”</p>

<p>“The other party, were they relations?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, it’s a policeman; a real policeman from
London. The secretary, I suppose, must have lost
his head, and insisted on making a <i>cause célèbre</i> of
the thing. I forgot him, by the way, a little chap
called Brinkman; he’s at the <i>Load</i> too. A thousand
pardons, but I see a fish rising. It is so rare an event
here that I must go and attend to it.” And, nodding
pleasantly, the old gentleman made his way to the
bank again.</p>

<p>Chilthorpe is a long, straggling village with the
business part (such as it is) at the lower end. The
church is here, and the <i>Load of Mischief</i>, and a few
shops; here, too, the Busk flows under a wide stone
bridge—a performance which at most times of the
day attracts a fair crowd of local spectators. The
houses are of grey stone, the roofs of blue slate.
The rest of the village climbs up along the valley
all in one street; the houses stand perched on the
edge of a steep slope, too steep almost for the
cultivation of gardens, though a few currant and
gooseberry bushes retain a precarious foothold. The view
has its charms; when mists hang over it in autumn,
or when the smoke of the chimneys lingers idly on a
still summer evening, it has a mysterious and
strangely un-English aspect.</p>

<p>The hostess, presumably to be identified with “J.
Davis, licensed to sell wines, spirits and tobacco,”
met them on the threshold, voluble and apparently
discouraging. Her idea seemed to be that she could
not have any more guests coming and committing
suicide in her house. Bredon, afraid that his patience
or his gravity would break down, put Angela in
charge of the conversation, and so delicate was her
tact, so well-placed her sympathy, that within ten
minutes their arrival was being hailed as a godsend,
and Mrs. Davis, ordering the barmaid to bring tea
as soon as it could be procured, ushered them into
a private room, assuring them of accommodation
upstairs when she could put things to rights. It had
been one thing after another, she complained, all
day, she didn’t really hardly know which way to
turn, and her house always a respectable one. There
was not much custom, it seemed, at Chilthorpe,
lying so far away from the main road and that—you
would have supposed that in a R.A.C. Listed
Hotel suicides were a matter of daily occurrence,
and the management knew how to deal with them.
Whereas Mrs. Davis hadn’t anybody but the girl
and the Boots, and him only with one arm. And those
boys coming and looking in through the front
window; “disgraceful,” she called it; and what were
the police for if they couldn’t put a stop to it? And
the reporters—six of them she’d turned away that
very day—coming and prying into what didn’t
concern them. They didn’t get a word out of her, that
was one thing.</p>

<p>Though, mark you, if Mrs. Davis didn’t know
poor Mr. Mottram, who did? Coming there regular
year after year for the fishing, poor gentleman; such
a quiet gentleman too, and never any goings-on. And
how was she to know what would come of it? It
wasn’t that the gas leaked; time and again she’d had
those pipes seen to, and no complaints made. If there
had have been anything wrong, Mr. Pulteney, he’d
have let her hear about it, he was one for having
everything just as he liked, and no mistake. . . .
Yes, that would be him, he was a great one for the
fishing. Such a queer gentleman too, and always
taking you up short. Why, yesterday morning, when
she went to tell him about what had happened in the
night he was as cool as anything; all he said was,
“In that case, Mrs. Davis, I will fish the Long Pool
this morning,” like that he said. Whereas Mr.
Brinkman, that was the secretary, he was in a great
taking about it, didn’t hardly know what he said or
did, Mr. Brinkman didn’t. And to think of all the
gas that was wasted; on all night it was, and who
was to pay for it was more than she knew. Summing
up, Mrs. Davis was understood to observe that it
was a world for sorrow, and man was cut down like
a flower, as the sparks fly upward. However, there
was them above as knew, and what would be
would be.</p>

<p>Of all this diatribe Bredon was a somewhat
languid auditor. He recognized the type too well to
suppose that any end was to be gained by
cross-examination. Angela cooed and sighed, and dabbed
her eyes now and again at appropriate moments, and
in so doing won golden opinions from the tyrannous
conversationalist. It was a strong contrast when the
maid came in with the tea things; she plumped them
down in silence, tossing her head defiantly, as who
should imply that somebody had recently found
fault with her behind the scenes, but she was not
going to take any notice of it. She was a strapping
girl, of undeniable good looks, spoilt (improved, the
Latins would have said) by a slight cast in one eye.
In the absence of any very formidable competition
it was easy to imagine her the belle of the village.
So resolute did her taciturnity appear that even
Angela, who could draw confidences from a stone,
instinctively decided that it would be best to
question her later on. Instead, she whiled away the
interminable interval which separates the arrival of
the milk jug from that of the teapot by idly turning
over the leaves of the old-fashioned visitors’ book.
The Misses Harrison, it appeared, had received
“every attention” from their kind and considerate
hostess. The Pullford Cycling Club had met for its
annual outing, and the members pronounced
themselves “full to bursting, and coming back next year.”
An obviously newly married couple had found the
neighbourhood “very quiet”; a subsequent
annotator had added the words “I don’t think!!!” with
the three marks of exclamation. The Wotherspoon
family, a large one, testified to having had a
“rattling good time” at this old-world hostelry. The
Reverend Arthur and Mrs. Stump would carry away
“many pleasant memories” of Chilthorpe and its
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Miles was wandering aimlessly about the room
inspecting those art treasures which stamp,
invariably and unmistakably, the best room of a small
country inn. There was the piano, badly out of tune,
with a promiscuous heap of dissenting hymn-books
and forgotten dance tunes reposing on it. There were
the two pictures which represent a lovers’ quarrel
and a lovers’ reconciliation, the hero and heroine
being portrayed in riding costume. There was a
small bookshelf, full of Sunday-school prizes,
interspersed with one or two advanced novels in cheap
editions, clearly left behind by earlier visitors.
There was a picture of Bournemouth in a frame of
repulsive shells. There was a photograph of some
local squire or other on horseback. There were
several portraits which were intended to perpetuate the
memory of the late Mr. Davis, a man of full bodily
habit, whose clothes, especially his collar, seemed
too tight for him. There were a couple of young
gentlemen in khaki on the mantelpiece; there was a
sailor, probably the one who had collected the
strange assortment of picture post-cards in the
album under the occasional table; there were three
wedding groups, all apparently in the family—in a
few words, a detective interested in such problems
might have read there, a picture, the incredibly long
and complicated annals of the poor.</p>

<p>To Bredon it was all a matter of intense
irritation. When he visited the scene of some crime or
some problem, he was fond of poking his way round
the furniture, trying to pick up hints from the books
and the knickknacks about the character of the
people he was dealing with. At least, he would say,
if you cannot pick up evidence about them you can
always catch something of their atmosphere.
Mottram had hardly played the game when he died in a
country inn where he had not been able to impress
his surroundings with any touch of his own quality;
this inn parlour was like any other inn parlour, and
the dead body upstairs would be a problem in
isolation, torn away as it was from its proper context.
The bedroom doubtless would have a text over the
washing-stand, a large wardrobe stuffed with family
clothes and mothballs, a cheap print of the “Soul’s
Awakening”; it would just be an inn bedroom, there
would be no Mottram about it.</p>

<p>“I say,” Angela interrupted suddenly, “Mottram
seems to have visited this place pretty regularly, and
always for the fishing season. There are some fine
specimens of his signature; the last only written two
days ago.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?” said Bredon. “Written his
signature in already, had he? Any date to it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is, ‘J. W. Mottram, June 13th
to’—and then a blank. He didn’t know quite how long
he would be staying, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see. . . . Look here, that’s all wrong, you
know. This isn’t a hotel register; it’s just a visitors’
book. And people who write in a visitors’ book don’t
write till the day they leave.”</p>

<p>“Necessarily?”</p>

<p>“Invariably. Look here: look at Arthur Stump.
You can see from his style and his handwriting what
a meticulous fellow he is. Well, he came here on
May twenty-first, and stayed till May twenty-six.
The Wilkinsons came here a day later, on the
twenty-second, and left on the twenty-fourth. But
the Wilkinson entry comes first, and that’s
because they left first, don’t you see? And here is
Violet Harris doing the same; she puts her name
before the Sandeman party. Look at Mottram’s entry
last year. He didn’t leave a blank then, and fill in
his date of departure afterward; you can always tell
when a thing is filled in afterward because the
spacing is never quite exact. No; Mottram did something
quite foreign to his habit when he wrote June
thirteenth to blank, and quite foreign to the habits of
every one I know.”</p>

<p>“You get these little ideas sometimes. No; you
can’t have tea till you come and sit at the table. I
don’t want you sloshing it about all over the place.
Now, what can have been the idea of writing that
entry? Nobody wanted proof that he’d been there.
Could it be a forgery, done from last year’s entry?
That would mean that it isn’t Mottram upstairs at
all, really.”</p>

<p>“We shall know that soon enough. . . . No;
there’s only one idea that seems to me to make sense.
He came to this place knowing that he was never
going to leave it alive. And consequently he wanted
to put an entry in the book which would make it look
as if he had been paying just an ordinary visit, and
was expecting to leave it alive. People will never see
that they’re overreaching themselves when they do
that kind of thing. It’s absurd to go on such slight
indications, but so far as I can see the presumption
is this: Mottram meant to commit suicide, and meant
to make it look as if he hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“The date’s all right, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Bound to be. No sense in falsifying it when it
could always be verified from the bill. Landladies
have a habit of knowing what night guests arrived.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see, then. He arrived on the thirteenth;
and he was found dead in the morning, that’s
yesterday morning, Tuesday. The thirteenth was
Monday—he’d only been here one night.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll hope we can find all that part out from
the secretary. I don’t much want another hour of
Mrs. Davis. Meanwhile, let’s see if you can knock
any more out of that teapot; I’m as thirsty as a
fish.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch04">

<h2>Chapter IV. <br/> The Bedroom</h2>

<p>They did not escape another dose of Mrs.
Davis, who appeared soon afterward to
announce that the big room upstairs was ready
for them, and would they step up and mind their
heads please, the stairs were that low. It was indeed
a rambling sort of house, on three or four different
levels, as country inns are wont to be; it did not
seem possible to reach any one room from any other
without going down and up again or up and down
again. At the head of the stairs Mrs. Davis turned
dramatically and pointed to a door marked “5”. “In
there!” she said, the complicated emotion in her
voice plainly indicating what was in there. To her
obvious confusion the door opened as she spoke, and
a little, dark man, whom they guessed then and
knew afterward to be the secretary, came out into
the passage. He was followed by a policeman—no
ingenuity could have doubted the fact—in plain
clothes. Bredon’s investigations were ordinarily made
independently of, and for the most part unknown to,
the official champions of justice. But on this
occasion Fate had played into his hands. “By Gad!”
he cried, “it’s Leyland!”</p>

<p>It was, and I will not weary the reader by
detailing the exclamations of surprise, the questionings,
the reminiscences, the explanations which followed.
Leyland had been an officer in the same battalion
with Bredon for more than two years of the war.
It was at a time when the authorities had perceived
that there were not enough well-dressed young men
in England to go round, and a Police Inspector who
had already made a name for efficiency easily
obtained commissioned rank; with equal ease he
returned to the position of an Inspector when
demobilized. Their memories of old comradeship promised
to be so exhaustive and, to the lay mind, so
exhausting, that Brinkman had gone downstairs and Angela
Bredon to their room long before it was over; nay,
Mrs. Davis herself, outtalked for once, retired to her
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Well, this is Al,” said Leyland at last. “Sure to
be left down here for a few days until I can clear
things up a bit. And if you’re working on the same
lay, there’s no reason why we should quarrel. Though
I don’t quite see what your people sent you down for
to start with.”</p>

<p>“Well, the man was very heavily insured, you
know; and, for one reason or another, the company
is inclined to suspect suicide. Of course if it’s suicide
it doesn’t pay up.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better lie low about it and stay on for
a few days. Good for you and Mrs. Bredon to get a
bit of a holiday. But of course suicide is right off
the map.”</p>

<p>“People do commit suicide, don’t they, by leaving
the gas on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they don’t get up and turn the gas off
and then go back to bed to die. They don’t open the
window, and leave it open”——</p>

<p>“The gas turned off? The window opened? You
don’t mean”——</p>

<p>“I mean that if it was suicide it was a very rum
kind of suicide, and if it was accident it was a very
rum kind of accident. Mark you, I’m saying that to
you; but don’t you go putting it about the place.
Some of these people in the inn may know more
about it than they ought to. Mum’s the word.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see that. Let’s see, who were there in
the house? This secretary fellow, and the old
gentleman I saw down by the river, I suppose, and Mrs.
Davis and the barmaid and the Boots—that’s all
I’ve heard of up to now. That’s right, keep ’em all
under suspicion. But I wish you’d let me see the
room; it seems to me there must be points of
interest about it.”</p>

<p>“Best see it now, I think. They’re going to fix up
the corpse properly to-night; so far they’ve left
things more or less untouched. There’s just light
enough left to have a look round.”</p>

<p>The inn must at some time have known better
days, for this room was generously proportioned,
and could clearly be used as a bed-sitting room. But
the wall-paper had seen long service; the decorations
were mean, the furniture shabby; it was not the sort
of accommodation that would attract a rich man from
Pullford but for the reputation the place had for
fishing and, perhaps, the want of any rival
establishment. Chilthorpe, in spite of its possibilities of
water-power, had no electric light; but the inn, with
one or two neighbouring houses, was lighted by
acetylene gas from a plant which served the
vicarage and the parish hall. These unpleasant fumes,
still hanging in the air after two days, were
responsible, it seemed, for the tragic loading of the
bed which stood beside them.</p>

<p>To this last, Bredon paid little attention. He had
no expert medical knowledge, and the cause of
death was unquestioned; both the local man and a
doctor whom the police had called in were positive
that the symptoms were those of gas poisoning and
that no other symptoms were present; that there
were no marks of violence, no indications even of a
struggle; the man had died, it seemed, in his sleep
as if from an overdose of anæsthetic. Beside his
bed stood a glass slightly encrusted with some
whitish mixture; Bredon turned toward Leyland with an
inquiring look as his eye met it.</p>

<p>“No good,” said Leyland. “We had it analysed,
and it’s quite a mild sort of sleeping draught. He
sometimes took them, it seems, because he slept
badly, especially in a strange bed. But there’s no
vice in the thing; it wouldn’t kill a man however
heavily he doped himself with it, the doctor says.”</p>

<p>“Of course it explains why he slept so soundly
and didn’t notice the gas leaking.”</p>

<p>“It does that; and, if it comes to that, it sets me
wondering a little. I mean, supposing it was murder,
it looks as if it was done by somebody who knew
Mottram’s habits.”</p>

<p>“If it was murder, yes. But if it <em>was</em> suicide, it’s
easy to understand the man doping himself, so that
he should die off more painlessly. The only thing
it doesn’t look like is accident, because it would be
rather a coincidence that he should happen to be laid
out by a sleeping draught just on the very night when
the gas was left on. I’d like to have a look at this
gas.”</p>

<p>There was a bracket on the wall, not far from the
door, which originally had been the only light in
the room. But for bed-sitting room purposes a special
fitting had been added to this giving a second vent
for the gas; and this new vent was connected by
a long piece of rubber tubing with a standard lamp
that stood on the writing-table near the window.
There were thus three taps in all, and all of these
close together on the bracket. One opened the jet
on the bracket itself, one led to the rubber tubing
and the standard lamp and the third was the oldest
and closest to the wall, serving to cut off the
supply of gas from both passages at once. This third
main tap was turned off now; of the other two, the
one on the bracket was closed, the one which led
to the standard lamp stood open.</p>

<p>“Is this how the taps were when the body was
first found?” asked Bredon.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Of course we’ve turned them on and off
since to make certain that the jets were both in
working order. They were, both of them. And we
tried the taps for finger-prints—with powder, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Any results?”</p>

<p>“Only on the main tap. We could just trace where it had
been turned on, with the thumb pressing on the
right-hand side. But there were no marks of fingers
turning it off.”</p>

<p>“That’s damned queer.”</p>

<p>“Gloves?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course you think it was murder. Still, if
it was murder it should have been the murderer who
turned it on <em>and</em> off. Why did he conceal his traces
in one case and not in the other?”</p>

<p>“Well, as a matter of fact, it was Mottram
who turned the gas on. At the main, that is. The tap
of the standard seems to have been on all the time,
at least there were no marks on it. That’s queer
too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if he wanted it to be known that he
committed suicide. But if he didn’t, you see, the whole
business may have been bluff.”</p>

<p>“I see, you want it to be suicide masquerading as
accident. I want it to be murder masquerading as
suicide. Your difficulty, it seems to me, is explaining
how the tap came to be turned off.”</p>

<p>“And yours?”</p>

<p>“I won’t conceal it. The door was locked, with the
key on the inside.”</p>

<p>“How did anybody get in, then, to find the
corpus?”</p>

<p>“Broke down the door. It was rotten, like
everything else in this house, and the hinges pulled the
screws out. You can see, there, where we’ve put
fresh screws in since.”</p>

<p>“Door locked on the inside. And the window?”
Bredon crossed to the other side of the room.
“Barred, eh?” It was an old-fashioned lattice window
with iron bars on the inside to protect it from
unauthorized approach. The window itself opened
outward, its movement free until it reached an angle of
forty-five degrees; at that point it passed over a
spring catch which made it fast. It was so made fast
now that Bredon examined it.</p>

<p>“This too?” he asked. “Was the window just like
this?”</p>

<p>“Just like that. Wide open, so that it’s hard to see
why the gas didn’t blow out of doors almost as soon
as it escaped; and there was a high wind on Monday
night, Pulteney tells me. And yet, with those bars,
it seems impossible that any one should have come
in through it.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re going to have difficulties over your
murder theory.”</p>

<p>“So are you, Bredon, over your suicide theory.
Look at that shirt over there; the studs carefully put
in overnight; and it’s a clean shirt, mark you; the
outside buttonholes haven’t been pierced. Do you
mean to tell me that a man who is going to commit
suicide is going to let himself in for all that
tiresome process of putting studs in before he goes to
bed?”</p>

<p>“And do you mean to tell me that a man goes out
fishing in a boiled shirt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if he’s a successful manufacturer. The idea
that one wears special clothes when one is going to
take exercise is an upper-class theory. I tell you,
I’ve seen a farmer getting in the hay in a dickey,
merely to show that he was a farmer, not a farm
labourer.”</p>

<p>“Well, grant the point; why shouldn’t a man who
wants to commit suicide put studs in his shirt to make
it look as if it wasn’t suicide? Remember, it was a
matter of half a million to his heirs. Is that too heavy
a price for the bother of it?”</p>

<p>“I see you’re convinced; it’s no good arguing with
you. Otherwise, I’d have pointed out that he wound
up his watch.”</p>

<p>“One does. To a man of methodical habit it’s an
effort to leave a watch unwound. Was he a smoker?”</p>

<p>“Brinkman says not. And there are no signs of it
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“The law ought to compel people to smoke. In
bed, especially—we should have got some very nice
indications of what he was really up to if he had
smoked in bed. But I see he wasn’t a bedroom
smoker in any case; here’s a solitary match which
has only been used to light the gas—he hasn’t burnt
a quarter of an inch of it.”</p>

<p>“That match worries me too. There’s a box on
the mantelpiece, but those are ordinary safeties.
This is a smaller kind altogether, and I can’t find
any of them in his pockets.”</p>

<p>“The maid might have been in before him and
lighted the gas.”</p>

<p>“They never do. At least, Mrs. Davis says they
never do.”</p>

<p>“It was dark when he went to bed?”</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock, Brinkman says. You would be
able to see your way then, but not much more. And
he must have lit the gas, to put the studs in his
shirt—besides, he’s left some writing, which was
probably done late that night, though we can’t
prove it.”</p>

<p>“Writing! Anything important?”</p>

<p>“Only a letter to some local rag at Pullford. Here
it is, if you want to read it.” And Leyland handed
Bredon a letter from the blotting-pad on the table.
It ran:</p>

<blockquote><div>

  <p class="address">To the Editor of the <i>Pullford Examiner</i>:</p>

  <p class="salutation">Dear Sir:</p>

  <p>Your correspondent, “Brutus,” in complaining of
  the closing of the Mottram Recreation Grounds at
  the hour of seven <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, describes these grounds as
  having been “presented to the town with money
  wrung from the pockets of the poor.” Now, Sir, I
  have nothing to do with the action of the Town
  Council in opening the Recreation Grounds or
  closing same. I write only as a private citizen who has
  done my best to make life amenable for the citizens
  of Pullford, to know why my name should be dragged
  into this controversy, and in the very injurious terms
  he has done. Such recreation grounds were presented
  by me twelve years ago to the townspeople of
  Pullford, not as “blood-money” at all, but because I
  wanted them, and especially the kiddies, to get a
  breath of God’s open air now and again. If “Brutus”
  will be kind enough to supply chapter and verse,
  showing where or how operatives in my pay have
  received less pay than what they ought to have
  done——</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>At this point the letter closed abruptly.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t very handy with his pen,” observed
Bredon. “I suppose friend Brinkman would have had
to get onto this in the morning and put it into
English. Yes, I know what you’re going to say: if the
man had foreseen his end he either wouldn’t have
taken the trouble to start the letter or else he’d have
taken the trouble to finish it. But I tell you, I don’t
like this letter—I say, we must be getting down to
dinner; attract suspicion, what, if we’re found
nosing round up here too long? All right, Leyland, I
won’t spoil your sport. What about having a fiver
on it—suicide or murder?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind if I do. What about telling one
another how we get on?”</p>

<p>“Let’s be quite free about that. But each side
shall keep notes of the case from day to day, putting
down his suspicions and his reasons for them, and
we’ll compare notes afterward. Ah, is that Mrs.
Davis? All right, we’re just coming.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>Chapter V. <br/> Supper, and Mr. Brinkman</h2>

<p>Mrs. Davis’s cuisine, if it did not quite
justify all the ironic comments of the old
gentleman, lent some colour to them. With
the adjectival trick of her class she always
underestimated quantity, referring to a large tureen as
“a drop of soup,” and overestimated quality, daily
suggesting for her guests’ supper “a nice chop.”
The chop always appeared; the nice chop (as the old
gentleman pointed out) would have been a pleasant
change. As surely as you had eggs and bacon for
breakfast, so surely you had a chop for supper;
“and some nice fruit to follow” heralded the entrance
of a depressed blanc-mange (which Mrs. Davis
called “shape,” after its principal attribute) and
some cold green-gages. These must have come from
Alcinous’s garden, for at no time of the year were
they out of season. If Angela had stayed in the house
for a fortnight, it is possible that she would have
taken Mrs. Davis in hand and inspired her with
larger ideas, As it was, she submitted, feeling that
a suicide in the house was sufficiently unsettling for
Mrs. Davis without further upheavals.</p>

<p>The coffee room at the <i>Load of Mischief</i> was not
large enough to let the company distribute itself
at different tables, each party conversing in low
tones and eyeing its neighbours with suspicion. A
single long table accommodated them all, an
arrangement which called for a constant exercise of forced
geniality. Bredon and Leyland were both in a mood
of contemplation, puzzling out the secret of the
room upstairs; Brinkman was plainly nervous, and
eager to avoid discussing the tragedy; Angela knew,
from experience in such situations, the value of
silence. Only the old gentleman seemed quite at his
ease, dragging in the subject of Mottram with
complete <i>sang-froid</i> and in a tone of irony which seemed
inseparable from his personality. Brinkman parried
these topical references with considerable adroitness,
showing himself as he did so a travelled man and a
man of intelligence, though without much gift of
humour.</p>

<p>Thus, in reply to a conventional question about
his day’s sport, the old gentleman returned, “No, I
cannot say that I caught any. I think, however, that
I may claim without boasting to have frightened a
few of them. It is an extraordinary thing to me
that Mottram, who was one of your grotesquely rich
men, should have come down for his fishing to an
impossible place like this, where every rise deserves
a paragraph in the local paper. If I were odiously
rich, I would go to one of these places in Scotland,
or Norway, even, though I confess that I loathe the
Scandinavians. I have never met them, but the
extravagant praise bestowed upon them by my
childhood’s geography books makes them detestable to
me.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Brinkman, “that you would find
some redeeming vices among the Swedes. But poor
Mottram’s reason was a simple one; he belonged to
these parts; Chilthorpe was his home town.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said the old gentleman, wincing slightly
at the Americanism.</p>

<p>“Oo, yes,” said Angela, “we saw Mottram on the
map. Was he a sort of local squire, then?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of that sort,” replied Brinkman. “His
people took their name from the place, not the other
way round. He started here with a big shop, which
he turned over to some relations of his when he
made good at Pullford. He quarrelled with them
afterward, but he always had a sentimental feeling
for the place. It’s astonishing what a number of
group names there are still left in England. There is
no clan system to explain it. Yet I suppose every
tenth family in this place is called ‘Pillock.’ ”</p>

<p>“It suggests the accident of birth,” admitted the
old gentleman, “rather than choice. And poor
Mottram’s family, you say, came from the district?”</p>

<p>“They had been here, I believe, for generations.
But this habit of naming the man from the place is
curiously English. Most nations have the patronymic
instinct; the Welsh, for example, or the Russians.
But with us, apparently, if a stranger moved into a
new district, he became John of Chilthorpe, and his
descendants were Chilthorpes for ever.”</p>

<p>“A strange taste,” pursued the old gentleman,
harping on the unwelcome subject, “to want to come
and lay your bones among your ancestors. It causes
so much fuss and even scandal. For myself, if I ever
decided to put a term to my own existence, I should
go to some abominable place—Margate, for example—and
try to give it a bad name by being washed up
just underneath the pier.”</p>

<p>“You would fail, sir,” objected Brinkman; “I
mean, as far as giving it a bad name was concerned.
You do not give things a good name or a bad name
nowadays; you only give them an advertisement.
I honestly believe that if a firm advertised its own
cigarettes as beastly it would draw money from an
inquisitive public.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Davis has had an inquisitive public to-day.
I assure you, when I went out this morning I was
followed for a considerable distance by a crowd of
small boys who probably thought that I intended to
drag the river. By the way, if they do drag the
river, it will be interesting to find out whether there
were, after all, any fish in it. You will let me be
present, sir?” turning to Leyland, who was plainly
annoyed by the appeal. Angela had to strike in and
ask who was the character in <i>Happy Thoughts</i> who
was always asking his friends to come down and drag
the pond. So the uneasy conversation zigzagged on,
Mr. Pulteney always returning to the subject which
occupied their thoughts, the rest heading him off.
Bredon was deliberately silent. He meant to have
an interview with Brinkman afterward, and he was
determined that Brinkman should have no chance of
sizing him up beforehand.</p>

<p>The opportunity was found without difficulty after
supper; Brinkman succumbed at once to the offer
of a cigar and a walk in the clear air of the summer
evening. Bredon had suggested sitting on the bridge,
but it was found that at that hour of the evening all
the seating accommodation was already booked.
Brinkman then proposed a visit to the Long Pool,
but Bredon excused himself on the ground of
distance. They climbed a little way up the hill road, and
found one of those benches, seldom occupied, which
seem to issue their invitation to travellers who are
short of breath. Here they could rest in solitude,
watching cloud after cloud as it turned to purple
in the dying sunlight and the shadows gathering
darker over the hill crests.</p>

<p>“I’m from the Indescribable, you know. Expect
Mrs. Davis has told you. I’d better show you my
cardcase so that you can see it’s correct. They send
me to fool round, you know, when this sort of thing
happens. Have to be careful, I suppose.” (“This
Brinkman,” he had said to Angela, “must take me
for a bit of a chump; if possible, worse than I
am.”)</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see”—— began Brinkman.</p>

<p>“Oh, the old thing, suicide, you know. Mark you,
they don’t absolutely bar it. I’ve known ’em pay
up when a fellow was obviously potty. But their rules
are against it. What I say is, If a man has the
pluck to do himself in he ought to get away with
the stakes, Well, all this must be a great nuisance
to you, Mr. Brickman”——</p>

<p>“Brinkman.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, always was a fool about names. Well, what
I mean is, it can’t be very pleasant for you to have
so many people nosing round; but it’s got to be done
somehow, and you seem to be the right man to come
to. D’you think there was anything wrong in the
upper story?”</p>

<p>“The man was as sane as you or I. I never knew
a man with such a level head.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s important. You don’t mind if I
scribble a note or two? I’ve got such a wretched memory.
Then, here’s another thing: was the old fellow
worried about anything? His health, for example?”</p>

<p>There was an infinitesimal pause; just for that
fraction of a second which is fatal, because it shews
that a man is making up his mind what to say. Then
Brinkman said: “Oh, there can be no doubt of that.
I thought he’d been and told your people about it.
He went to a doctor in London and was told that
he’d only two more years to live.”</p>

<p>“Meaning, I suppose”——</p>

<p>“He never told me. He was always a peculiar man
about his health; he got worried even if he had a
boil on his neck. No, I don’t think he was a
hypochondriac; he was a man who’d had no experience of
ill-health, and the least thing scared him. When he
told me about his interview with the specialist he
seemed all broken up, and I hadn’t the heart to
question him about it. Besides, it wasn’t my place.
I expect you’ll find that he never told any one.”</p>

<p>“One could ask the medico, I suppose. But they’re
devilish close, ain’t they, those fellows.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to find out his name first. Mottram
was very secret about it; if he wrote to make an
appointment, the letter wasn’t sent through me. It’s
a difficult job, circularizing Harley Street.”</p>

<p>“All the same the doctor in Pullford might know.
He probably recommended somebody.”</p>

<p>“What doctor in Pullford? I don’t believe
Mottram’s been to a doctor any time these last five years.
I was always asking him to these last few months
because he told me he was worried about his health,
though he never told me what the symptoms were.
It’s difficult to explain his secretiveness to anybody
who didn’t know him. But, look here, if you’re
inclined to think that his story about going to a
specialist was all a lie, you’re on the wrong track.”</p>

<p>“You feel certain of that?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely certain. Look at his position. In two
years’ time he was due to get a whacking annuity
from your company if he lived. He was prepared to
drop his claim if the company would pay back half
his premiums. You’ve heard that, I expect? Well,
where was the sense of that, unless he really thought
he was going to die?”</p>

<p>“You can’t think of any other reason for his
wanting to do himself in? Just bored with life, don’t
you know, or what not?”</p>

<p>“Talk sense, Mr. Bredon. You know as well as I
do that all the suicides one hears of come from
money troubles, or disappointment in love, or sheer
melancholia, There’s no question of money troubles;
his lawyers will tell you that. He was not at the time
of life when men fall badly in love, bachelors
anyhow; and his name was never coupled with a
woman’s. And as for melancholia, nobody who knew
him could suspect him of it.”</p>

<p>“I see you’re quite convinced that it was suicide.
No question of accident, you think, or of dirty
work at the crossroads? These rich men have
enemies, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“In story-books. But I doubt if any living soul
would have laid hands on Mottram. And as for
accident, how would you connect it with all this yarn
about the specialist? And why was the door of his
room locked when he died? You can ask the servants
at Pullford; they’ll tell you that his room was never
locked when he was at home; and the Boots here
will tell you that he had orders to bring in
shaving-water first thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, his door was locked, was it? Fact is, I’ve
heard very little about how the thing was discovered.
I suppose you were one of the party when the body
was found?”</p>

<p>“I was. I’m not likely to forget it. Not that I’ve
any objection to suicide; mark you, I think it’s a
fine thing, very often; and the Christian
condemnation of it merely echoes a private quarrel between
St. Augustine and some heretics of his day. But it
breaks you up rather when you find a man you
said ‘Good-night’ to the night before lying there all
gassed. . . . However, you want to know the
details. The Boots tried to get in with the
shaving-water, and found the door locked; tried to look
through the keyhole and couldn’t; came round to me
and told me about it. I was afraid something must be
wrong, and I didn’t quite like breaking down the
door with only the Boots to help me. Then I looked
out of the window, and saw the doctor here, a man
called Ferrers, going down to take his morning bath.
The Boots went and fetched him, and he agreed the
only thing was to break down the door. Well, that
was easier than we thought. There was a beastly
smell of gas about, of course, even in the passage.
The doctor went up to the gas, you know, and found
it turned off. I don’t know how that happened; the
tap’s very loose, anyhow, and I fancy he may have
turned it off himself without knowing it. Then he
went to the bed, and it didn’t take him a couple of
minutes to find out that poor old Mottram was dead,
and what he’d died of. The key was found on the
inside of the door, turned so that the lock was
fastened. Between you and me, I have a feeling that
Leyland is wondering about that tap. But it’s
obvious that nobody got into the room, and dead men
don’t turn off taps. I can’t piece it together except
as suicide myself. I’m afraid your company will be
able to call me as a witness.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course it’s all jam to them. Not that they
mind coughing up much; but it’s the principle of
the thing, you see. They don’t like to encourage
suicide. By the way, can you tell me who the heirs
are? What I mean is, I suppose a man doesn’t insure
his life and then take it unless he makes certain
who comes in for the bullion?”</p>

<p>“The heirs, as I was saying at supper, are local
people. Actually a nephew, I believe—I didn’t want
to say more at the time, because I think between
ourselves that Mr. Pulteney shows rather too much
curiosity. But Mottram quarrelled with this young
fellow for some reason—he owns the big shop here;
and I’m pretty certain he won’t be mentioned in the
will.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know who the lucky fellow is?”</p>

<p>“Charities, I suppose. Mottram never discussed
it with me. But I imagine you could find out from
the solicitors, because it’s bound to be common
property before long in any case.”</p>

<p>Bredon consulted, or affected to consult, a list of
entries in his pocketbook. “Well, that’s awfully kind
of you. I think that’s all I wanted to ask. Must think
me a beastly interfering sort of fellow. Oh, one other
thing—is your room anywhere near the one Mr.
Mottram had? Would you have heard any sounds
in the night, I mean, if there’d been anything going
on in his room above the ordinary?”</p>

<p>“My room’s exactly above, and my window must
have been open. If there were any suspicion of
murder, I should be quite prepared to give evidence that
there was nothing in the nature of a violent struggle.
You see, I sleep pretty light, and that night I didn’t
get to sleep till after twelve. It was seven o’clock in
the morning when we found him, and the doctor
seemed to think he’d been dead some hours. I heard
nothing at all from downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m tremendously obliged to you. Perhaps
we’d better be wandering back, eh? You’re
unmarried, of course, so you don’t have people fussing
about you when you sit out of an evening.” In this
happy vein of rather foolish good fellowship Bredon
conducted his fellow guest back to the inn; and it is
to be presumed that Brinkman did not feel that he
had spent the evening in the company of a
Napoleonic brain.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch06">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br/> An Ear at the Keyhole</h2>

<p>On their return to their coffee room they found
Mr. Pulteney in sole possession, He was
solemnly filling in a cross-word puzzle in a
daily newspaper about three weeks old. Leyland had
gone off to the bar parlour, intent on picking up the
gossip of the village. Bredon excused himself and
went upstairs to find that Angela was not yet
thinking of bed, she had only got tired of a cross-word
puzzle. “Well,” she asked, “and what do you make
of Mr. Brinkman?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s a bit deep. I think he knows just
a little more about all this than he says. However,
I let him talk, and did my best to make him think
I was a fool.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve been doing with Mr.
Pulteney. At least, I’ve been playing the <i>ingénue</i>. I
thought I was going to get him to call me ‘My
dear young lady’—I love that; he very nearly did
once or twice.”</p>

<p>“Did you find him deep?”</p>

<p>“Not in that way. Miles, I forbid you to suspect
Mr. Pulteney; he’s my favourite man. He told me
that suicide generally followed, instead of
preceding, the arrival of young ladies. I giggled.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d drown himself. He’s one too many in
this darned place. And it’s all confusing enough
without him.”</p>

<p>“Want me to put in some Watson work?”</p>

<p>“If you aren’t wanting to go to bed.” Watson
work meant that Angela tried to suggest new ideas
to her husband under a mask of carefully assumed
stupidity. “You see, I’m all for suicide. My instincts
tell me that it’s suicide. I can smell it in the air.”</p>

<p>“I only smelt acetylene. Why suicide
particularly?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the locked door. I’ve still got to see
the Boots and verify Brinkman’s facts; but a door
locked on the inside, with barred windows, makes
nonsense of Leyland’s idea.”</p>

<p>“But a murderer might want to lock the door,
so as to give himself time to escape.”</p>

<p>“Exactly; but he’d lock it on the outside. On
the other hand, a locked door looks like suicide,
because, unless Brinkman is lying, Mottram didn’t
lock his door as a rule; and the Boots had orders
to go into the room with shaving-water that
morning.”</p>

<p>“Why the Boots? Why not the maid?”</p>

<p>“Angela, don’t be so painfully modern! Maid
servants at country hotels don’t. They leave some
tepid water on the mat, make a gentle rustling noise
at the door, and tiptoe away. No, I’m sure he locked
the door for fear Brinkman should come in in the
middle—or Pulteney, of course, might have come
to the wrong door by mistake. He wanted to be left
undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“But not necessarily in order to commit suicide.”</p>

<p>“You mean he might have fallen asleep over
something else he was doing? Writing a letter for
example, to the <i>Pullford Examiner</i>? But in that case
he wouldn’t have been in bed. You can’t gas
yourself by accident except in your sleep. Then there’s
another thing—the Bertillon mark on the gas-tap.
Leyland is smart enough to know the difference
between the mark you leave when you turn it on
and the mark you leave when you turn it off. But
he won’t follow out his own conclusions. If Mottram
had gone to bed in the ordinary way, as he must
have in the event of foul play or accident, we should
have seen where he turned it off as well as where he
turned it on. The point is, Mottram didn’t turn the
<em>light</em> on at all. He went to bed in the half-darkness,
took his sleeping draught, and turned on the gas.”</p>

<p>“But, angel pet, how could he write a long letter
to the Pullford paper in the half-darkness? And how
did he read his shocker in the half-darkness? Let’s
be just to poor Mr. Leyland, though he is in the
force.”</p>

<p>“I was coming on to that. Meanwhile, I say he
didn’t light the gas. Because if you want to light
the gas you have to do it in two places, and the
match he used, the only match we found in the
room, had hardly burned for a second.”</p>

<p>“Then why did he strike a match at all?”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that too. Finally, there’s the
question of the taps. A murderer would want to make
certain of doing his work quickly, therefore he
would make sure that the gas was pouring out of
both jets, the one on the bracket on the wall and
the one on the standard lamp by the window. The
suicide, if he means to die in his sleep, isn’t in a
hurry to go off. On the contrary, he wants to make
sure that his sleeping draught takes effect before
the gas fumes become objectionable. So he turns on
only one of the two jets, and that is the one farthest
away from him. Isn’t that all right?”</p>

<p>“You are ingenious, you know, Miles,
occasionally. I’m always so afraid that one day you’ll find
<em>me</em> out. Now let’s hear about all the things you
were just coming to.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it isn’t a simple case of suicide.
Why should it be? People who have taken out a
Euthanasia policy don’t want Tom, Dick and Harry
to know—more particularly, they don’t want Miles
Bredon to know—that they have committed suicide.
They have the habit, as I know from experience, of
trying to put up a little problem in detection for
me, the brutes!”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t be angry with them, Miles. After
all, if they didn’t the Indescribable might sack you,
and then where would Francis’s new tam-o’-shanter
come from?”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt, woman! This is a case of suicide
with complications, and dashed ingenious ones. In
the first place, we noticed that entry in the visitors’
book. That’s an attempt to make it look as if he
expected a long stay here, before he went to bed.
Actually, through not studying the habits of the
Wilkinsons, he overshot himself there—a little too
ingenious. <em>We</em> know that when he did that he was
simply trying to lead us up the garden; but we
were too clever for him.”</p>

<p>“Let me merely mention the fact that it was I
who spotted that entry. But pray proceed.”</p>

<p>“Then he did two quite irreconcilable things:
he took a sleeping draught and he asked to be called
early. Now, a man who’s on a holiday, and is afraid
he won’t sleep, doesn’t make arrangements to be
called early in the morning. <em>We</em> know that he took
the sleeping draught so as to die painlessly; and as
for being called early in the morning it was probably
so as to give the impression that his death was quite
unpremeditated. He took several other precautions
for the same reason.”</p>

<p>“Such as?”</p>

<p>“He wound up his watch. Leyland noticed that,
but he didn’t notice that it was an eight-day watch.
A methodical person winds up his eight-day watch
on Sunday; once more, Mottram was a tiny bit too
ingenious. Then he put the studs out ready in his
shirt. Very few people when they’re on holiday take
the trouble to do that. Mottram did because he
wanted us to think that he meant to get up the
next morning in the ordinary way.”</p>

<p>“And the next article?”</p>

<p>“The window. A murderer, not taking any risks,
would shut the window, or see that it was shut,
before he turned the gas on. A man going to bed in
the ordinary way would either shut it completely or
else open it to its full extent, where the hasp catches,
so that in either case it shouldn’t bang during the
night. Mottram left his window ajar, not enough
open to let the gas escape much. But he knew that
in the morning the door would have to be knocked
in, and with that sudden rush of air the window
would swing open. Which is exactly what happened.”</p>

<p>“I believe he wrote and told you about all this
beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Silence, woman! He left a shocker by his
bedside, to make us think that he went to bed at peace
with all the world. In real life, if you take a dose
you don’t read yourself to sleep as well. Besides, if
he had been wanting to read in bed he would have
brought the standard lamp over to his bedside so as
to put it out last thing. Further, he had a letter
ready written, or rather half-written, which he left
on the blotting-pad. But he hadn’t written it there—he
wrote it downstairs. I found the place where he
had blotted it on the pad in the dining-room.
Another deliberate effort to suggest that he had gone
to sleep peacefully, leaving a job half-finished. And
then, of course, there was the match.”</p>

<p>“You mean he only struck it to give the
impression that he’d lit the gas, but didn’t really light it?
I’m getting the hang of the thing, aren’t I? By the
way, he couldn’t have lit another match and thrown
it out of the window?”</p>

<p>“Very unlikely. Only smokers, and tidy ones at
that, throw matches out of the window. He either
had one match left in his pocket or borrowed one
from Brinkman. But he didn’t use it; suicides like
the dark. There’s one other tiny point—you see
that?” He took up a large, cheap Bible which stood
at the bedside of their own room. “There’s a society
which provides those, and of course there’s one for
each room. Mottram had taken his away from the
bedside and put it in a drawer. It’s funny how
superstitious we men are, when all’s said and done.”</p>

<p>“That’s a tiny bit grooly, isn’t it? Well, when are
you going to dig the grave at the crossroads and
borrow a stake from the local carpenter?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, there’s just that trifling difficulty
about the tap being turned off. Leyland is right in
saying that dead men don’t do that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“What’s Brinky’s explanation?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Brinkman, to whom you were only
introduced three hours ago, thinks the doctor turned it
off accidentally in the morning. That’s nonsense, of
course. His idea was that the tap was very loose,
but it wasn’t, really—Leyland had it loosened on
purpose, so as to be able to turn it without
obliterating the finger-marks. If it hadn’t been stiff, of course,
there’d have been no marks left at all. So there’s a
three-pipe problem for you, my dear Mrs. Hudson.”</p>

<p>Angela’s forehead wrinkled becomingly. “Two
problems, my poor old Lestrade. How did the tap
get turned off, and why does Brinky want us to
think it got turned off accidental? I always like you
to have plenty of theories, because it keeps your
mind active; but with my well-known womanly
intuition I should say it was a plain issue between the
locked door, which means suicide, and the
turned-off tap, which means murder. Did I hear you putting
a fiver on it with Leyland?”</p>

<p>“You did. There’s dashed little you don’t hear.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ve got a fiver on it, of course it’s
got to be suicide. That’s a good, wifely point of
view, isn’t it? I wish it were the other way round;
I believe I could account for that door if I were
put to it. But I won’t; I wonder how Leyland’s
getting on?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s worse off than we are, because he’s got
to get over the door trouble, and he’s got to find a
motive for the murder <em>and</em> a criminal to convict of
it. We score there; if it’s suicide, there can be no
two theories about the criminal! And we know the
motive—partly, anyhow. Mottram did it in order to
make certain of that half-million for his legatees.
And we shall soon know who they are. The only
motive that worries me is Brinkman’s: Why’s he
so keen on its being suicide? Perhaps the will would
make that clear too. . . . I can’t work it out at
present.” He began to stride up and down the room.
“I’m perfectly certain about that door. It’s
impossible that it should be a spring-lock, in an
old-fashioned hotel like this.” He went up to the door
of their room, and bent down to examine it. Then,
with startling suddenness, he turned the handle and
threw it open. “Angela, come here. . . . You see
that picture in the passage? There’s no wind to make
it swing like that, is there?”</p>

<p>“You mean you think somebody’s been”——</p>

<p>“Just as I bent down to the door, I could have
sworn I heard footsteps going softly away. It must
have been somebody actually at the keyhole.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you run out?”</p>

<p>“Well, it makes it so dashed awkward to find
somebody listening and catch them at it. In some
ways it’s much better to know that somebody has
been listening and for them not to know whether you
know or not. It’s confoundedly awkward, all the
same.”</p>

<p>“Idiotic of us not to have remembered that we
were in a country pub, and that servants in country
pubs still do listen at keyholes.”</p>

<p>“Servants? Well, ye-es. But Pulteney’s room is
only just round that corner.”</p>

<p>“Miles, I will not have you talking of poor old
Edward like that.”</p>

<p>“Who told you his name was Edward?”</p>

<p>“It must be; you’ve only to look at him.
Anyhow, he will always be Edward to me. But he simply
couldn’t listen at a keyhole. He would regard it
as a somewhat unconventional proceeding” (this
with a fair imitation of Mr. Pulteney’s voice).
“Besides, he can’t <em>nearly</em> have finished that cross-word
yet. He’s very stupid without me to help him; he
<em>will</em> always put down ‘EMU’ when there’s a bird of
three letters.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, Brinkman’s room is only up one
flight of stairs. As you say, it may be the servants,
or even Mrs. Davis herself; but I’d like to feel sure
of that. I wonder how much of what we said was
overheard.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miles dear, you ought to know. Don’t you
remember how you listened at the kitchen door in
old Solomon’s house, and thought you heard a man’s
voice and found out afterward it was only the
loud-speaker?”</p>

<p>“Good God, why does one marry? Look here, I’m
just going to have a look around for old Leyland,
and warn him that there’s dirty work at the
crossroads.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he must be careful not to soliloquize too
much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly. It’s time you went to bed; I
won’t be more than half an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“Not beyond closing time, in other words? Gosh,
what a man! Well, walk quietly, and don’t wake
Edward.”</p>

<p>Bredon found Leyland still in the bar parlour,
listening patiently to the interminable theorizings
of the oldest inhabitant. “That’s how it was, you see.
Tried to turn off the gars, and didn’t turn it off
proper, that’s what he did. He didn’t think to lay
hands on himself, stands to reason he didn’t. What
for should he, and him so rich and all? Mark you,
I’ve known Mottram when he wasn’t no higher than
that chair yonder, not so much he wasn’t; and I
know what I’m talking about. I’ve seen suicides
put away too, I have; I recollect poor Johnny Pillock
up at the toll-house; went mad he did, and hung
himself off of a tree the same as if it might be from
the ceiling yonder. Ah! There wasn’t no gars in
them days. Good-night, Mr. Warren, and pleasant
dreams to you; you mind them stairs in your front
garden. Yes, powerful rich Mottram he was,” and
so on without cessation or remorse. It was nearly
closing time before Bredon managed to drag the
policeman away and warn him that there were others
(it appeared) besides themselves who were
interested in the secret of the upstairs room.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch07">

<h2>Chapter VII. <br/> From Leyland’s Note-Book</h2>

<p>“Now that I have put that fiver on with
Bredon, I begin to doubt my own
conclusions. That is the extraordinary effect of
having a ‘will to believe.’ As long as you have no
prejudices in the case, no brief to maintain, you can
form a theory and feel that it is a mathematical
certainty. Directly you have a reason for wanting to
believe the thing true that same theory begins to
look as if it had all sorts of holes in it. Or rather,
the whole theory seems fantastic—you have been
basing too much on insufficient evidence. Yesterday
I was as certain that the case was one of murder
as I am certain of my own existence. To-day I am
developing scruples. Let me get it all down on paper,
anyhow; and I shall be able to shew my working
  to Bredon afterward, however the case turns out.</p>

<p>“There is one indication which is absolutely vital,
absolutely essential: that is the turning off of the
tap. That is the pinpoint of truth upon which any
theory must rest. I don’t say it’s easy to explain
the action; but it is an action, and the action
demands an agent. The fact that the gas was tampered
with would convince me of foul play, even if there
were no other direct indications. There are such
indications.</p>

<p>“In the first place, the window: If the window
had stood all night as it was found in the morning,
wide open and held by its clasp, there could have
been no death. Pulteney tells me that there was a
strong east wind blowing most of the night, and
you can trust a fisherman to be accurate in these
matters. The window, then, like the gas, had been
deliberately arranged in an artificial position
between Mottram’s death and the arrival of the rescue
party. If the death had been accidental, the window
would have been shut and remained shut all night.
You do not leave a window half open, with nothing
to fix it, on a windy night. If it had been a case of
suicide, it is equally clear that the window would
have remained shut all night. If you are proposing
to gas yourself you do not take risks of the window
blowing open and leaving you half-asphyxiated.
There is only one explanation of the open window,
as there is of the gas-tap: and that explanation
involves the interference of a person or persons
unknown.</p>

<p>“Another direct indication is the match found in
the grate. Bredon’s suggestion that this match was
used by the maid earlier in the evening is quite
impossible; there was a box on the mantelpiece, which
would be plainly visible in daylight, and it was not
one of those matches that was used. It was a smaller
match, of a painfully ordinary kind; Brinkman uses
such matches, and Pulteney, and probably every
smoker within miles around. Now, the match was
not used to light the gas. It would have been
necessary to light the gas in two places, and the match
would have burned some little way down the stem,
whereas this one was put out almost as soon as it
was lit. It must have been used, I think, to light
the gas in the passage outside, but of this I cannot
be sure. It was thrown carelessly into the grate
because, no doubt, the nocturnal visitor assumed as a
matter of course that others like it would already
have been thrown into the grate. As a matter of fact,
Mottram must have thrown the match he lit the
gas with out of the window: I have not found it.</p>

<p>“From various indications, it is fairly clear that
Mottram did not foresee his end. Chief among these
is the order which he gave that he was to be woken
early in the morning. This might of course be bluff;
but if so it was a very heartless kind of bluff, for
it involved the disturbing of the whole household
with the tragic news in the small hours, instead of
leaving it to transpire after breakfast. And this
leads us on to another point, which Bredon appears
to have overlooked: A man who wants to be woken
up early in the morning does not take a sleeping
draught overnight. It follows that <em>Mottram did not
really take the sleeping draught</em>. And that means
that the glass containing it was deliberately put by
his bed to act as a blind. The medical evidence is
not positive as to whether he actually took the stuff
or not. My conjecture is, then, that the man who
came in during the night—twice during the night—put
a glass with the remains of a sleeping draught
by the bed in order to create the impression that
Mottram had committed suicide.</p>

<p>“When I struck upon this idea, it threw a flood
of light on various other details of the case. We
have to deal with a murderer who is anxious to
create the impression that the victim has died by
his own hand. It was for this reason that he left
a half-finished letter of Mottram’s on the
table—a letter which Mottram had actually written
downstairs; this would look like the regular suicide’s
dodge of trying to cover up his tracks by leaving a
half-finished document about. It would make a mind
like Bredon’s suspect suicide at once. The same may
be said of the ridiculous care with which the dead
man was supposed to have wound up an eight-day
watch before retiring; it was a piece of bluff which
in itself would deceive nobody; but here it was
double bluff, and I expect it has deceived Bredon.
He will see everywhere the marks of a suicide
covering up his tracks, which is exactly what the
murderer meant him to see.</p>

<p>“The thing begins to take shape in my mind, then,
as follows: When he feels confident that his victim
is asleep the murderer tiptoes into the room, puts
down the glass by the bedside and the letter on the
table; winds up the watch (a very silent one); then
goes over to the gas, wipes off with a rag the mark
of Mottram’s hand turning it off, and then, with
the same rag, gently turns it on once more. The
window is already shut. He tiptoes through the
doorway, and waits for an hour or two till the gas has
done its deadly work. Then, for some reason, he
returns; for what reason, I cannot at present
determine. Once he had taken all these precautions,
it must have looked to him as if a verdict of suicide
was a foregone conclusion. But it is a trick of the
murderer—due, some think, to the workings of a
guilty conscience—to revisit the scene of his crime
and spoil the whole effect of it. It is this reason,
of course, that I must find out before I am certain
of my case; leaving aside all further questions as
to the murderer’s identity and his motives.</p>

<p>“In fact, there are two problems: a problem of
why and a problem of how. <em>Why</em> did the murderer
turn the gas off? And <em>how</em> did he leave the door
locked behind him? I suspect that the answer to the
first question is, as I have said, merely
psychological; it was some momentary instinct of bravado, or
remorse, or sheer lunacy. The answer to the second
question must be something more complicated. In
the abstract it is, I suppose, possible to turn a key
in a lock from the wrong side by using a piece of
wire or some instrument. But it is almost
inconceivable that a man could do this without leaving
scratches on the key; I have examined the key very
carefully and there are no scratches. Bredon, I can
see, hopes to arrive at some different conclusion
about the evidence; somebody, he thinks, is lying.
But Brinkman, and Ferrers the doctor, and the
Boots, all rushed into the room at the same
moment. Ferrers is an honest man, and I am sure he
is telling the truth when he says he found the gas
turned off; and he went to it at once, before either
of the others had time to interfere. It was the Boots
who found the key on the inside of the door, and
the Boots will not do for the murderer; a man with
one hand cannot have done conjuring tricks with
a lock. Brinkman’s own evidence is perfectly
straightforward and consistent with that of the
others. He seems secretive, but that, I think, is the
fellow’s manner. I cannot at present see any motive
which could have made him want to do away with
Mottram; the two seem to have been on intimate
terms, and there is no evidence of a quarrel.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to exonerate Pulteney of all
knowledge, even of all interest in the affair. He was a
complete stranger to Mottram, so far as I can
discover. But suspicion may equally well fall on
people outside the house; for, although the doors
of the inn were locked, there is a practicable window
on the ground floor which is not always shut at
night. Mottram was known in Chilthorpe, and had
lived there when he was young; there is the chance,
then, of a local vendetta. Pullford is only twenty
miles or so distant; and in Pullford he may easily
have had enemies; the letter from ‘Brutus’ shews
that. But, since the salient fact about Mottram was
his wealth, it seems obvious that the first question
to be settled is that of his testamentary
dispositions. I must telegraph to London to-morrow for full
information about these, and pursue my local
inquiries in the mean time. The only person on the
spot who has any close tie of blood with the
deceased is the young fellow who owns the big shop
here. He is Mottram’s nephew; Mottram himself
started it long ago, and afterward made it over to
his sister and her husband, both of whom are now
dead. Unfortunately for himself, the young man
seems to have been something of a radical, and he
made an injudicious speech at a time when Mottram
was proposing to run himself as an independent
Parliamentary candidate for the constituency.
There was a quarrel; and Mrs. Davis thinks that
the two never met again.</p>

<p>“These are only my first impressions. They may
have to be revised drastically as the case proceeds.
But of one thing I am confident—there has been
foul play, and the effort to represent it as a case
of suicide is necessarily doomed to failure.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch08">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br/> The Bishop at Home</h2>

<p>Angela and her husband breakfasted late
next morning. Leyland came in as they were
finishing, his manner full of excitement.
“Mrs. Davis,” he explained, “has been talking to
me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be led on too much by that,” said Angela.
“It has happened to others.”</p>

<p>“No, but I mean, Mrs. Davis has been saying
something.”</p>

<p>“That is far more unusual,” assented Bredon.
“Let’s hear all about it. Angela”——</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bredon,” said Angela firmly, “has been
associated with me in many of my cases, and you
may speak freely in her presence. Cough it up,
Mr. Leyland; nothing is going to separate me from
this piece of toast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing private about it
particularly. But I thought perhaps you might help. You
see, Mrs. Davis says that Mottram was expecting a
visitor to turn up in the morning and go out
fishing with him.”</p>

<p>“A mysterious stranger?” suggested Angela.
“Carrying a blunt instrument?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, as a matter of fact it was the Bishop
of Pullford. Do you know Pullford at all?”</p>

<p>“Nothing is hidden from us, Mr. Leyland. They
make drain-pipes there, not perambulators, as some
have supposed. The parish church is a fine
specimen of early Perp. It has been the seat of a Roman
Catholic Bishopric—oh! I suppose that’s the man?”</p>

<p>“So Mrs. Davis explained. A very genial man. Not
one of your standoffish ones. He was expected, it
seems, by the first train, which gets in about ten.
Mottram left word that he was to be called early,
because he wanted to get at the fishing, and the
Bishop, when he arrived, was to be asked to join
Mr. Mottram on the river; he would be at the Long
Pool. He’d been down here before, apparently, as
Mottram’s guest. Now, it’s obvious that we had
better find out what the Bishop has to say about
all this. I’d go myself only for one thing: I don’t
quite like leaving Chilthorpe while my suspicions”
(he dropped his voice) “are so undefined; and for
another thing, I’ve telegraphed up to London for
details about the will and I want to be certain that
the answer comes straight to my own hands. And
the inquest is at four this afternoon; I can’t risk
being late for that. I was wondering whether you
and Mrs. Bredon would care to run over there?
It would take you less than an hour in the car, and
if you went as representing the Indescribable it
would make it all rather less—well, official. Then I
thought perhaps at the end of the day we might
swap information.”</p>

<p>“What about it, Angy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall come and see the Bishop.
It doesn’t sound quite proper, somehow. But I’ll
drive you into Pullford, and sit at the hotel for a
bit and have luncheon there, and you can pick me
up.”</p>

<p>“All right. I say, though,” he added piteously,
“shall I have to go and change my suit?”</p>

<p>“Not for a moment. You can explain to the Bishop
that your Sunday trousers are in pawn; if he’s really
genial he’ll appreciate that. Besides, that tweed suit
makes you look like a good-natured sort of ass; and
that’s what you want, isn’t it? After all, if you do
stay to lunch, it will only be a bachelor party.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, we’ll go. Just when I was
beginning to like Chilthorpe! Look here, Leyland, you
aren’t expecting me to serve a summons on the
Bishop or clap the darbies on him, or anything?
Because if so you’d better go yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I don’t suspect the Bishop—not
particularly, that is. I just want to know what he can tell
us about Mottram’s movements immediately before
his death, and what sort of man he was generally.
He may even know something about the will; but
there’s no need to drag that topic in, because my
telegram ought to produce full information about
that. Thanks awfully. And we’ll pool the day’s
information, eh?”</p>

<p>“Done. I say, though, I think I’d better just wire
to the Bishop, to make sure that he’s at home, and
ready to receive a stray spy. Then we can start
at elevenish.”</p>

<p>As Bredon returned from sending the telegram, he
was waylaid, to his surprise, by Mr. Pulteney, who
was fooling about with rods and reels and things
in the front hall. “I wonder if I might make a
suggestion to you, Mr. Bredon,” he said. “I despise
myself for the weakness, but you know how it is.
Every man thinks in his heart that he would have
made a good detective. I ought to know better at
my age, but the foul fiend keeps urging me to point
something out to you.”</p>

<p>Bredon smiled at the elaborate address. “I should
like to hear it awfully,” he said. “After all,
detection is only a mixture of common sense and special
knowledge, so why shouldn’t we all put something
into the pot?”</p>

<p>“It is special knowledge that is in question here;
otherwise I would not have ventured to approach
you. You see that rod? It is, as you doubtless know,
Mottram’s; it is the one which he intended to take
out with him on that fatal morning. You see those
flies on it?”</p>

<p>They looked to Bredon very much like any other
flies, and he said so.</p>

<p>“Exactly. That is where special knowledge comes
in. I don’t know this river very well; but I do know
that it would be ridiculous to try to fish this river
with those particular flies, especially at this time of
the year and after the weather we’ve been having.
And I do know that a man like Mottram, who had
been fishing this river year after year, couldn’t
possibly have imagined that it was any use taking those
flies down to the Long Pool. I only mention it
because it makes me rather wonder whether Mottram
really came down here to fish. Well, I must be
starting for the river. Still nursing the
unconquerable hope. Good-morning.” And, with one of his
sudden gestures, the old gentleman was gone.</p>

<p>A telegram came in admirably good time,
assuring Bredon that the Bishop would be delighted to
see him. It was little after eleven when the car took
the road again; this time their way brought them
closer to the Busk and gave them a better view of
its curious formation. A narrow gorge opened
beneath them, and they looked down into deep pools
overhung by smooth rocks that the water had eaten
away at their base. There was no actual waterfall,
but the stream always hurried downward, chuckling
to itself under and around the boulders which
interrupted its course. “I think Pulteney
overestimates the danger of having his river dragged,”
observed Bredon. “You couldn’t drag that part of it;
and, with all those shelves of rock, a corpse might
lie for days undiscovered, and no one the wiser.
I’m glad that it’s a death by gas, not by drowning.”</p>

<p>Their road now climbed onto the moors, and they
began to draw closer to a desolate kind of
civilization. Little factory towns which had sprung up when
direct water-power was in demand, and continued a
precarious existence perched on those barren slopes
now that water-power had been displaced by steam,
were the mile-stones of their route. They were jolted
on a pavement of villainous sets; the air grew dim
with a smoky haze and the moorland blackened with
their approach to the haunts of men. At last
tram-lines met them, announcing the outskirts of Pullford.
“I’m getting the needle rather about this interview,”
confessed Bredon. “What does one do by way of
making one’s self popular with a Catholic Bishop?”
he demanded of Angela, who was convent-bred.</p>

<p>“Well, the right thing is to go down on one knee
and kiss his ring. I don’t think you’d make much of
a show at it; we ought to have practised it before we
left Chilthorpe. But I don’t suppose he’ll eat you.”</p>

<p>Bredon tried to rearrange his ideas about Bishops.
He remembered the ceremony of being confirmed
at school; a long, tiresome service, with an
interminable address in which he and fifty of his
compeers were adjured to play for their side. He
remembered another Bishop, met in a friend’s rooms
at Oxford, a hand laid on his shoulder and an
intolerably earnest voice asking whether he had ever
thought of taking holy orders. Was that the sort of
thing? Or was he rather to expect some
silken-tongued courtier, in purple and fine linen,
pledging him in rich liqueurs (as in the advertisements)
and lying to him smoothly (as in the story-books)?
Was he to be embarrassed by pietism or to be
hoodwinked by a practised intriguer? Anyhow, he would
know the worst before long now. They drew up at
the centre of the town before a vast, smoke-grimed
hotel which promised every sort of discomfort; and
Bredon, after asking his way to the Catholic
Cathedral, and steadying himself with a vermuth, went
out to face the interview.</p>

<p>The Cathedral house proved to be a good
specimen of that curious municipal Gothic which is the
curse of all institutions founded in 1850. The kind
of house which is characterized by the guide-books
as fine, by its inmates as beastly. The large room
into which Bredon was shewn was at least equally
cheerless. It was half-panelled in atrocious
pitch-pine, and it had heavy, ecclesiastical-looking chairs
which discouraged all attempts at repose. There was
a gas-stove in the fireplace. Previous occupants of
the See of Pullford lined the walls, in the worst
possible style of portraiture. A plaster Madonna of the
kind that is successively exiled from the church to
the sacristy and from the sacristy to the presbytery
at once caught and repelled the eye. In point of fact,
the room is never used except by the canons of
Pullford when they vest for the chapter mass and
by the strange visitor who looks a little too
important to be left in a waiting-room downstairs.</p>

<p>A door opened at the end of the room, and through
it came a tall man dressed in black with a dash of
red whose welcome made you forget at once all the
chill of the reception room. The face was strong and
determined, yet unaffectedly benevolent; the eyes
met you squarely, and did not languish at you; the
manner was one of embarrassed dignity, with no
suggestion of personal greatness. You did not feel
that there was the slightest danger of being asked
whether you meant to take orders. You did not
catch the smallest hint of policy or of priestcraft.
Bredon made a gesture as if to carry out Angela’s
uncomfortable prescription; but the hand that had
caught his was at once withdrawn in obvious
deprecation. He had come there as a spy, expecting to be
spied upon; he found himself mysteriously fitting
into this strange household as an old friend.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr.
Brendan.” (The Chilthorpe post-office is not at its
best with proper names.) “Come inside, please. So
you’ve come to have a word about poor old
Mottram? He was an old friend of ours here, you know,
and a close neighbour. You had a splendid morning
for motoring. Come in, please.” And Bredon found
himself in a much smaller room, the obvious
sanctum of a bachelor. There were pipes about, and
pipe-cleaners; there was a pleasant litter of documents
on the table; there was a piano standing open, as
pianos do when people are accustomed to strum on
them for mere pleasure; there was a quite
unashamed loud-speaker in one corner. The chair into
which the visitor was shepherded was voluminous
and comfortable; you could not sit nervously on the
edge of it if you tried. Instinctively, in such a room
your hand felt for your tobacco-pouch. Would Mr.
“Brendan” take anything before dinner? Dinner was
due in three quarters of an hour. Yes, it was a very
sad business about poor Mottram. There was a
feeling of genuine regret in the town.</p>

<p>“I don’t really know whether I’d any right to
trespass on My Lordship’s—on Your Lordship’s
time at all,” began Bredon, fighting down a growing
sense of familiarity. “It was only that the landlady
told us this morning you were expected to join
Mottram at Chilthorpe just on the morning when
he died. So we naturally thought you might have
known something about his movements and his plans.
When I say ‘we,’ I mean that I’m more or less
working in with the police, because the Inspector down
there happens to be a man I know.” (Dash it all,
why was he putting all his cards on the table like
this?)</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, I should be only too glad if I can
be of any use. The newspapers have just mentioned
the death as if it were an accident, but one of my
priests was telling me there is a rumour in the town
that the poor fellow took his own life. Well, of
course, I don’t think that very probable.”</p>

<p>“He was quite cheerful, you mean, when you last
saw him?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t say cheerful, exactly; but, you
see, he was always a bit of a dismal Jimmy. But he
was in here one evening not a week ago; very glad
to be going off for his holiday, and full of fishing
plans. It was then he asked me to come down and
join him just for the day. Well, there was a tempting
hole in my engagement book, and there’s a useful
train in the morning to Chilthorpe, so I promised I
would. Then the Vicar General rang me up the last
thing at night and told me about an important
interview with some education person which he’d
arranged behind my back. So I gave it up—one has to
do what one’s told—and was meaning to telegraph
to Mottram in the morning. And then this sad news
came along before I had time to telegraph after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the news got here as early as that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that secretary of his wired to me,
Brinkman. It was kind of him to think of me, for I know
the man very little. I forget the exact words he used,
‘Regret to say Mr. Mottram died last night, useless
your coming,’ something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“Do you know if he meant to make any long stay
at Chilthorpe?”</p>

<p>“Brinkman would be able to tell you better than
I could; but I fancy they generally spent about a
fortnight there every year. Mottram himself, I
daresay you know, came from those parts. So far as I
knew, this was to be the regular yearly visit.
Honestly, I can’t think why he should have been at pains
to ask me down there if there had been any idea of
suicide in his mind. Of course if there was definite
insanity that’s a different thing. But there was
nothing about him to suggest it.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand that Mottram belonged to
your—that Mottram was a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no! I don’t think he was a church-goer
at all. I think he believed in Almighty God, you
know; he was quite an intelligent man, though he
had not had much schooling when he was young. But
his friendship with us was just a matter of chance—that
and the fact that his house is so close to us. He
was always very kindly disposed toward us—a
peculiar man, Mr. ‘Brendan,’ and a very obstinate man
in some ways. He liked being in the right, and
proving himself in the right; but he was broad-minded
in religious matters, very.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think that he would have shrunk from
the idea of suicide—on any moral grounds, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“He did defend suicide in a chat we had the other
day. Of course my own feeling is that by the time a
man has got to the state of nerves in which suicide
seems the only way out he has generally got beyond
the stage at which he can really sit down and argue
whether it is right or wrong. At least one hopes so.
I don’t think that a person who defends suicide in
the abstract is any more the likely to commit
suicide for that or vice versa. Apart from grace, of
course. But it’s the absence of motive, Mr.
‘Brendan.’ Why should Mottram have wanted to take his
own life?”</p>

<p>“Well, My Lord, I’m afraid I see these things from
an uncharitable angle. You see, my business is all
connected with insurance; and Mottram was insured
with us, and insured heavily.”</p>

<p>“Well, there you are, you see; you have the
experience and I haven’t. But doesn’t it seem to you
strange that a man in good health, who digests his
meals, and has no worries, should take his own life
in the hope of benefiting his heirs, whoever they may
prove to be? He had no family, you must
remember.”</p>

<p>“In good health? Then—then he didn’t mention
anything to you about his life prospects?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that he did; but he always seemed
to me to enjoy good health. Why, was there
anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“My Lord, I think this ought to be confidential, if
you don’t mind. But since you knew him so well I
think it’s only fair to mention to you that Mottram
had misgivings about his health.” And he narrated
the story of Mottram’s singular interview at the
Indescribable offices. The Bishop looked grave when
he had finished.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, I’d no notion of that; no notion at
all. And it’s not clear even now what was wrong with
him? Well, of course that alters things. It must be a
grave temptation for people who are suffering from
a malignant disease, especially if it’s a painful one;
pain clouds the reason so, doesn’t it? I wish I’d
realized that he was in trouble, though it’s very
little one can do. But that’s just like him; he was
always a bit of a stoic; fine, in a rugged sort of way.
‘It never did any good meeting troubles half way,’
he used to say to me. Well, money can’t do
everything for us.”</p>

<p>“He was enormously rich, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Hardly that. He was very comfortably off,
though. There will be a windfall, I suppose, coming
to somebody.”</p>

<p>“He never mentioned to you, I suppose, what he
meant to do with his money?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, he used to say half-jokingly that
he was going to provide for us; but I don’t think he
meant us to take that seriously. He had a kind of
hankering after religion, you see, but he didn’t get
on well with religious people as a general thing. The
Anglicans, he said, were all at sixes and sevens, and
he couldn’t bear a church which didn’t know its own
mind. The non-conformists, he said, did no sort of
good in the town; all those fine chapels, and only
thirty or forty people in each of them on a Sunday
morning. He was a little unjust, I think, to the
non-conformists; they do a great deal of good, some of
them. And about the Salvation Army he was
extraordinarily bitter. So he used to say he’d sooner his
money went to us than to any of the others. But I
think that was only an ironic way he had with him;
people who have made a lot of money are often
fond of talking about what they’re going to do with
it. Of course it would have made a lot of difference
to us; but I don’t think he meant to be taken
seriously.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m very much obliged to Your Lordship;
I think, perhaps, I ought to be”——</p>

<p>“What, going away, and dinner on the table? No,
no, Mr. ‘Brendan,’ that isn’t how we treat our guests
at Pullford. Just you come along, now, and be
introduced to some of the reverend clergy. I know
the <i>Load of Mischief</i>, and those chops! Come on, and
we’ll send you off in better trim than you came.” It
was evident that there was no help for it; Angela
must wait.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch09">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br/> The Late Rector of Hipley</h2>

<p>The dinner-table left a blurred impression on
Bredon, for all his habit of observing his
fellow men and analysing his feelings about
them. The setting-out of the meal had faults that
Angela would have condemned, and would have put
right in no time; you were conscious at once that the
household belonged to bachelors. Yet the meal itself
and the cooking of it were of excellent quality; and
it was thrown at you with a clamorous, insistent
hospitality that made you feel like a guest of honour.
The room seemed to be full of priests—there were
five, perhaps, in reality, besides the Bishop—and
every detail of their behaviour proved that they
were free from any sense of formality or restraint;
yet constant little attentions shewed the guest that
he was never forgotten. The topic of conversation
which Bredon (who in the mean time had informed
the Bishop of the post-office mistake) could recall
most distinctly afterward was a learned and almost
technical discussion between the Bishop and the
youngest priest present on the prospects of the
local soccer team for next year. Nothing fitted in,
somehow, with his scheme of probabilities; there was
a Father O’Shaughnessy, who had been born and
bred in Pullford and never seemed to have been
outside it; there was a Father Edwards who talked with
a violent Irish brogue. A teetotaller opposite kept
plying him with Barsac.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a delicate attention that Bredon’s
neighbour, on the side away from the Bishop, was
the only other layman present. He was introduced
as the Bishop’s secretary; and he was the only man
in the room who looked like a clergyman. He seemed
some fifty years old; he was silent by habit, and
spoke with a dry humour that seemed to amuse
everybody except himself. Bredon could not help
wondering how such a man came to occupy such a
position at his time of life, for his voice betrayed
university education and he was plainly competent,
yet he obviously thought of himself as a
supernumerary in the household. The riddle was solved
when Bredon, in answer to some question about his
journey down to Chilthorpe, explained that he did
not come from London itself, but from a village in
Surrey, a place called Burrington. “What!”
exclaimed Mr. Eames, the secretary, “not Burrington
near Hipley?” And, when Bredon asked if he knew
Hipley, “Know it? I ought to. I was rector there
for ten years.”</p>

<p>The picture of the rectory at Hipley stood out
before Bredon’s mind; you see it from the main
road. There is an old-fashioned tennis-lawn in front
of it; roses cluster round it endearingly; there is a
cool dignity about the Queen Anne house, the
terraces of which are spotlessly mowed. Yes, you could
put this man in clerical clothes, and he would fit
beautifully into that spacious garden; you saw him,
with surplice fluttering in the breeze, going up the
churchyard path to ring the bell for evening service;
that was his atmosphere. And here, unfrocked by
his own conscience, he was living as a hired servant,
almost a pensioner, in this gaunt house, these
cheerless rooms. . . . You wondered less at his silent
habit, and his melancholy airs of speech.</p>

<p>Nothing creates intimacy like a common
background discovered among strangers. They belonged,
it seemed, to the same university, the same college;
their periods were widely different, but dons and
scouts, the mile-stones of short-lived undergraduate
memory, were recalled, and their mannerisms
discussed; and when at the end of the meal the Bishop
rose, profuse in his apologies, to attend a meeting,
Eames volunteered to walk Bredon back to his hotel.
“I thought there’d be no harm, My Lord, if we just
took a look in at poor Mottram’s house; I daresay
it would interest Mr. Bredon to see it. The
housekeeper,” he explained to Bredon, “is one of our
people.”</p>

<p>The Bishop approved the suggestion; and with a
chorus of farewells they left the Cathedral house
together. “Well,” said Bredon to his companion,
“you’ve got a wonderful Bishop here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Eames, “the mind dwells with pleasure
on the thought of him. There are few of us for whom
more can be said than that.”</p>

<p>“I can’t fit Mottram, from what I’ve heard of
him, into that household.”</p>

<p>“Because you’re not a provincial. Our common
roots are in Oxford and in London. But in a place
like this people know one another because they are
neighbours.”</p>

<p>“Even the clergy?”</p>

<p>“The Catholic clergy, anyhow. You see, our
priests don’t swap about from one diocese to
another; they are tied to the soil. Consequently they
are local men, most of them, and a local man feels
at home with them.”</p>

<p>“Still, for a man who had no religion particularly,
isn’t it rather a challenge to be up against your
faith like that? I should have thought a man was
bound to react one way or the other.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. It’s astonishing what a lot of
theoretical interest a man can take in the faith and
yet be miles away from it practically. Why, Mottram
himself, about three weeks ago, was pestering us all
about the old question of ‘the end justifying the
means.’ Being a Protestant, of course he meant by
that doing evil in order that good may come. He
worried the life out of the Bishop, urging the most
plausible reasons for maintaining that it was
perfectly right. He simply couldn’t see why the Bishop
insisted you weren’t ever allowed to do what’s wrong,
whatever comes of it. And the odd thing was, he
really seemed to think he was being more Catholic
over it than we were. However, all that bores you.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I want to know everything about
Mottram; and it’s silly to pretend that a man’s
religion doesn’t matter. Was he thinking at all, do
you suppose, of becoming a Catholic?”</p>

<p>Eames shrugged his shoulders. “How can I tell?
I don’t think he really shewed any dispositions. But
of course he was a religious man in a way, he wasn’t
one of your nogoddites, like Brinkman. You’ve met
Brinkman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m staying in the same hotel, you see. And
I confess I’m interested in him too. What do you
make of him? Who is he, or where did Mottram pick
him up?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t like the little man. I don’t
even know what his nationality is; he’s spent a long
time in Paris, and I’m pretty sure he’s not British.
And mind you, he hated us. I think he had
corresponded for some paper out in Paris; anyhow, he
knew all the seedy anti-clericals; and I rather think
he was asked to leave. Mottram seems to have taken
him on on the recommendation of a friend; he had
some idea, I think, of doing a history of the town;
and of course Brinkman can write. But Brinkman
very seldom came in here, and when he did he was
like a dog among snakes. I daresay he thought the
house was full of oubliettes. He’d got all that
Continental anti-clericalism, you see. Here’s the house.”</p>

<p>They turned up a short drive which led them
through a heavily walled park to the front door of a
painfully mid-Victorian mansion. A mansion it must
be called; it did not look like a house. Strange
reminiscences of various styles, Gothic, Byzantine,
Oriental, seemed to have been laid on by some external
process to a red-brick abomination of the early
seventies. Cream-coloured and slate-coloured tiles
wove irrelevant patterns across the bare spaces of
wall, Conservatories masked a good half of the
lowest storey. It was exactly suited to be what it
afterward became, a kind of municipal museum, in
which the historic antiquities of Pullford, such as
they were, could be visited by the public on dreary
Sunday afternoons.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Eames, “does that give you
Mottram’s atmosphere?”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” replied Bredon.</p>

<p>“See then the penalty of too great riches. Only
one man in a thousand can express his personality
in his surroundings if he has a million of money
to do it with. It wasn’t Mottram, of course, who did
this; but he would have built the same sort of horror
if he hadn’t taken it over from a predecessor like
himself. And the rooms are as bad as the house.”</p>

<p>Eames was fully justified in this last criticism.
The house was full of expensive bad taste; the crude
work of local artists hung on the walls; bulging
goddesses supported unnecessary capitals; velvet
and tarnished gilding and multicoloured slabs of
marble completed the resemblance to a large station
restaurant. Mottram had possessed no private
household gods, had preserved no cherished knickknacks.
The house was the fruit of his money, not of his
personality. He had given the architect a free hand,
and in the midst of all that barbaric splendour he
had lived a homeless exile.</p>

<p>The housekeeper had little to add to what Bredon
already knew. Her master usually went away for a
holiday about that time in the year, and Mr.
Brinkman always went with him. He had expected to be
away for a fortnight, or perhaps three weeks. He
had not shewn, to the servants at any rate, any
signs of depression or anxiety; he had not left any
parting messages to suggest a long absence. His
letters were to be redirected, as usual, to the <i>Load of
Mischief</i>. There had been none, as a matter of fact,
except a few bills and circulars. She didn’t think
that Mr. Mottram went to any of the Pullford
doctors, regularly at least; and she had had no
knowledge of his seeing the specialist in London. She did
not remember Mr. Mottram being ill, except for an
occasional cold, though he did now and again take
a sleeping draught.</p>

<p>“It’s quite true,” said Eames as they left the
house, “that we never noticed any signs of depression
or anxiety in Mottram. But I do remember, only a
short time ago, his seeming rather excited one
evening when he was round with us. Or am I imagining
it? Memory and imagination are such close
neighbours. But I do think that when he asked the Bishop
to go and stay down at Chilthorpe he seemed
unnaturally insistent about it. He was fond of the Bishop,
of course, but I shouldn’t have thought he was as
fond of him as all that. To hear him talk, you would
think that it was going to make all the difference to
him whether the Bishop shared his holiday or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I wonder what that points to?”</p>

<p>“Anything or nothing. It’s possible, of course,
that he was feeling depressed, as he well might be;
and thought that he wanted more than Brinkman’s
company to help him over a bad time. Or—I don’t
know. He was always secretive. He gave the Bishop
a car, you know; and took endless pains to find out
beforehand what sort of car would be useful to
him, without ever giving away what he was doing
till the last moment. And the other evening—well, I
feel now as if I’d felt then that he had something up
his sleeve. But did I really feel it then? I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“On the whole, though, you incline to the suicide
theory?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that. It’s possible, isn’t it, that a
man who had some premonition of a violent end
might want company when he went to a lonely place
like Chilthorpe?”</p>

<p>“Had he any enemies, do you think, in Pullford?”</p>

<p>“Who hasn’t? But not that sort of enemies. He
used, I fancy, to be something of a martinet with
his work-people, in the old manner. In America, a
disgruntled employee sometimes satisfies his
vendetta with a shotgun. But in England we have no
murdering classes. Even the burglars, I am told,
make a principle of going unarmed, for fear they
might be tempted to shoot. You would probably find
two or three hundred men in Pullford who would
grouse at Mottram’s success and call him a
bloodsucker, but not one who would up with a piece of
lead piping if he met him in a lonely lane.”</p>

<p>“I say, it’s been very kind of you looking after
me like this. I wish, if you’ve any time to spare in
the next day or two, you would drop down to
Chilthorpe and help me to make the case out. Or is that
asking too much?”</p>

<p>“Not the least. The Bishop goes off to a
confirmation to-morrow and I shall probably have time
on my hands. If you think I could be of any use, I’ll
certainly look in. I like Chilthorpe; every prospect
pleases and only the chops are vile. No, I won’t come
in, thanks; I ought to be getting back now.”</p>

<p>Angela was a little inclined to be satirical at her
husband’s prolonged absence; but she seemed to
have killed the time with some success. She had not
even been reduced to going round the early Perp.
church. They made short work of the way back to
Chilthorpe, and found Leyland eagerly awaiting
them at the door of the hotel.</p>

<p>“Well,” he asked, “have you found out anything
about Mottram?”</p>

<p>“Not much, and that’s a fact. Except that a man
who strikes me as a competent observer thought he
had noticed a certain amount of excitement in
Mottram’s manner last week, as if he had been more
than ordinarily anxious to get the Bishop to stay
with him. That, and the impression made on the
same observer that he was keeping dark about
something—had something up his sleeve. I have seen the
house; it is a beastly place; and it has electric light
laid on, of course. I have seen the housekeeper, an
entirely harmless woman, partly Irish by extraction,
who has nothing to add to what we know, and does
not believe that Mottram habitually employed any
of the Pullford doctors.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what about the Bishop?”</p>

<p>“Exactly, what about him? I find his atmosphere
very difficult to convey. He was very nice to me and
very hospitable; he has not the overpowering
manners of a great man, and yet his dignities seem to sit
on him quite easily. He is entirely natural, and I am
prepared to go bail for his being an honest man.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Leyland, “is just as well.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean? Have you had the answer to
your telegram?”</p>

<p>“I have, and a very full answer it is. The solicitors
gave all the facts without a murmur. About fifteen
years ago Mottram made a will which was chiefly in
favour of his nephew. A few years later he cancelled
that will absolutely and made another will in which
he devised his property to certain public
purposes—stinkingly useless ones, as is the way of these very
rich men. I can’t remember it all; but he wants his
house to be turned into a silly sort of museum, and
he provides for the erection of a municipal art
gallery—that sort of thing. But this is the important
point: His Euthanasia policy was not mentioned at
all in the later will. Three weeks ago he put in a
codicil directing how the money he expects from the
Indescribable is to be disposed of.”</p>

<p>“Namely how?”</p>

<p>“The entire half-million goes to the Bishop of
Pullford to be administered by him for the benefit of
his diocese as he and his successors shall think fit!”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br/> The Bet Doubled</h2>

<p>There was no time to discuss the
implications of this unexpected announcement, for
the inquest was just beginning, and neither
Leyland nor Bredon could afford to miss it. There
was a decayed outbuilding which adjoined the <i>Load
of Mischief</i>, the scene, you fancied, of the farmers’
ordinary in more prosperous times. Here the good
men and true were to deliver their verdict and the
Coroner his platitudes.</p>

<p>Brinkman’s evidence need not be repeated here,
for it followed exactly the lines we already know.
The local doctor and the Boots corroborated his
account so far as the discovery of the corpse was
concerned. Particular attention was naturally called
to the tap and to the locked door. The doctor was
absolutely positive that the tap was turned off when
he reached it; the fumes had blown away a good
deal by that time, and his first action was to put a
match to both jets in turn. Neither gave the least
promise of a flame, although the jet on the standard
stood open; there was no doubt, then, that the main
tap sufficiently controlled both outlets. Asked
whether he turned the main tap on to experiment, the
doctor said “No,” and was congratulated by the
Coroner on his circumspection. The work of the
police would be much facilitated, observed that
prudent functionary, if people would leave things
as they found them. After testing the gas the doctor’s
next action had been to attend to the patient. Much
medical detail followed at this point, but with no
results that would be new to us. Asked how long it
would have taken for the gas to cause asphyxiation,
the doctor was uncertain. It all depended, he said,
on the position of the window, which must clearly at
some time have blown farther open than it had been
originally. It was his impression that the death must
have occurred about one o’clock in the morning;
but there were no sure tests by which the exact
moment of death could be determined.</p>

<p>The Boots, by his own account, entered the room
immediately after the doctor. The door of the room
had fallen almost flat when it fell in; not quite flat,
for it was not entirely separated from the lower
hinge. The Boots made his way over this, and helped
the doctor by supplying him with a match. When the
doctor went across to the bed, he himself went to
the window to throw the match out. Dr. Ferrers had
joined Mr. Brinkman at the bed, so he devoted
himself to examining, and trying to hoist up, the
wreckage of the door. The lock was right out, and the key
duly turned on the inside of the door. It was not
usual for him to call guests in the morning, but he
had arranged to do so on that particular occasion.
He noticed the smell of gas even outside the door,
but did not feel sure there was anything wrong until
he tried the door and found it locked. It was not
usual for guests to lock their doors in that hotel,
although keys were provided for the purpose. Yes, he
did bend down and look through the keyhole, but it
was completely dark—naturally, since the key was
in the lock. He went and asked Mr. Brinkman what
he should do, because he was anxious not to go
beyond his orders.</p>

<p>The barmaid had really nothing to contribute. She
had not been into the room at all after six o’clock or
it might be half-past on the Monday evening, when
she went in to put everything to rights. Pressed to
interpret this phrase, she said it meant turning down
the corner of the bedclothes. She had not struck a
match, naturally, since it was broad daylight. She
had never noticed any leak of gas in that room since
the plumber had paid a visit in the previous March.
There was nothing wrong, she thought, about the
catch of the window; certainly no visitor had ever
complained of its fetching loose in the night. The
Bible, she thought, had been by the bedside when
she went into the room at six or it might have been
half-past. She did not move it, nor did she interfere
in any way with the arrangements of the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis confirmed this evidence as far as it
needed confirmation. It was she who had taken the
order from Mottram about his being called early in
the morning. He had spoken to her quite naturally,
and said good-night to her cheerfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Pulteney’s evidence was entirely negligible.
He had noticed nothing the evening before, had
heard nothing in the night, had not entered the room
since the tragedy occurred.</p>

<p>The Coroner spread himself in his allocution to
the jurymen. He reminded them that an escape of gas
could not properly be described as an act of God. He
pointed out that it was impossible to return a
verdict of death from unknown causes, since the cause
of death was known. If they were prepared to give
any new explanation of the fact that the gas was
turned off, they might bring in a verdict of death by
misadventure, or by suicide; in the latter case, it
was possible to add a rider saying that the deceased
was of unsound mind. If they were prepared to give
any new explanation of the locked door, it was
possible for them to bring in a verdict of wilful murder
against a person or persons unknown.</p>

<p>The jurymen, unequal to the intellectual strain
which seemed to be demanded of them, returned an
open verdict. The Coroner thanked them, and made
them a little speech which had not really much
bearing on the situation. He pointed out the superiority
of electric light over gas; in a house lit by electric
light this could never have happened. He called
attention to the importance of making certain that
the gas was turned off before you got into bed, and
the almost equal importance of seeing that your
window was well and truly opened. And so the inquest
ended, and Mottram, who had expressed no desire
in his will as to where or how he should be buried,
was laid to rest next day in the churchyard of the
little town which had seen his early struggles, and
Pullford remembered him no more.</p>

<p>As soon as the inquest was over, Leyland and
Bredon met by arrangement to discuss further the
bearings of the new discovery. They avoided the inn
itself, partly because the day’s events had left it
overcrowded, partly because they were afraid, since
Bredon’s experience the night before, of speaking
to a concealed audience. A slight rain was falling,
and they betook themselves to the back of the inn,
where a rambling path led along the river-bank
through the ruins of an old mill. Next the disused
mill-wheel there was a little room or shed, whose
gaping walls and roof afforded, nevertheless,
sufficient shelter from the weather. A “rustic seat,”
made of knobby branches overlaid with dark brown
varnish, offered uncomfortable repose. Draughts at
the back of your neck, or sudden leakage in the
slates above you, would cause you now and again to
shift your attitude uneasily; but, since the <i>Load of
Mischief</i> did not abound with amenities in any case,
they were content with their quarters.</p>

<p>“I confess I’m a little shaken,” admitted Bredon.
“Not that I see any logical reason for altering my
own point of view; but I don’t <em>want</em> it to be suicide
now as much as I did. The Bishop is such a jolly
old man; and he could so obviously do with half a
million, if only to put in new wall-paper. He might
even give his secretary a rise. I tell you, I hate the
idea of advising the company not to pay up. It can
afford the money so easily. But I suppose I must
have a sort of conscience about me somewhere, for
I’m still determined to get at the truth. This codicil,
you say, was put in less than three weeks ago?”</p>

<p>“Just about that. As nearly as I can calculate it
must have been just before, not after, Mottram’s
visit to the Indescribable.”</p>

<p>“The thing becomes more confusing than ever. If
he did want to endow the Diocese of Pullford, why
did he offer to resign his Euthanasia claim on
condition that we repaid half his premiums? And if he
didn’t want to endow the Diocese of Pullford, why
did he take the trouble of altering his will in its
favour?”</p>

<p>“Remember, when he drew up the codicil he may
not have seen the specialist.”</p>

<p>“That’s true too. Now, look here, supposing he
hadn’t put the codicil in, what would have become of
the Euthanasia money? Would it have gone, like the
rest, into these silly schemes of his about art
galleries?”</p>

<p>“No; it wasn’t just a vague will, nothing about
‘all I die possessed of.’ The whole thing was itemized
very clearly, and no allowance had been made at all
for the disposal of the Euthanasia money.
Consequently, if he hadn’t made the codicil, the
Euthanasia money would have gone to his next of kin.”</p>

<p>“In fact, to this nephew? Really, I begin to want
to see this nephew.”</p>

<p>“You have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Seen him—where?”</p>

<p>“At the inquest. Didn’t you notice a rather seedy
little fellow, with a face like a rat, who was standing
about in the porch just when it was over? That’s
your man; Simmonds his name is, and if you want
to get a taste of his quality, nothing’s easier, for he
serves in his own shop. On a plea of braces trouble,
shortage of cough lozenges, or what you will, his
time is yours from ten in the morning to seven at
night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed the little man. I can’t say I was
prepossessed. But I must certainly improve the
acquaintance. I suppose it’s not fair to ask what you
make of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, personally, I can’t say I’ve made much of
him. I had a talk, and his manner and statements
seemed to be perfectly straightforward. No
nervousness, no embarrassment.”</p>

<p>“There’s one other thing about Mottram’s will
that’s clearly important. You got it, I gather, from
the solicitors; did you find out from them whether
the terms of it were made public in any way?”</p>

<p>“About the main will they thought there was no
secret. Mottram seems to have talked it over with
members of the Pullford Town Council. Also the
lawyers were directed to send a full statement of it
to young Simmonds, as a kind of rebuke; Simmonds,
you see, had annoyed Mottram at the time. But this
codicil was a different affair; it was extremely
confidential. Brinkman himself—though of course he
may have been lying, or being discreet—professed
ignorance of it. I should think it very improbable
that anybody knows about it yet, except you and me
and Mrs. Bredon and of course the lawyers
themselves.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s a chance, I suppose, that Simmonds
thought, and still thinks, he is coming in for a
windfall from our company? Or do you think he didn’t
know Mottram was insured?”</p>

<p>“He must have; because the Euthanasia policy
was explicitly mentioned in the earlier will, the one
which was cancelled. So you are not the only person
who’s interested in young Simmonds. Well, what do
you make of it all?”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you one thing; it wouldn’t be fair if
I didn’t. About three weeks ago Mottram had an
argument with the Bishop of Pullford on a matter of
theology. Mottram was trying to persuade the
Bishop that you were morally justified in doing evil
in order that good might come of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m very much obliged for the information, old
man, but I’m not much interested in these
speculative questions. I’m concerned to hunt out the people
who do evil, whether good comes of it or not.”</p>

<p>“But the information doesn’t impress you?”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Will you double that bet?”</p>

<p>“Double the bet? You’re mad! Why, I was just
going to make the same offer, feeling sure you’d
refuse. It’s taking your money.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. Are you on?”</p>

<p>“On? Why, I’m prepared to redouble if you like.”</p>

<p>“Done! That’s twenty pounds each way. Now,
would you like to hear my reading of the story?”</p>

<p>“By all means. And then I shall have the pleasure
of putting you wise.”</p>

<p>“Well, from the first, the whole thing smelled of
suicide to me. Every step Mottram took seemed to
be the calculated step of a man who was leading up
to some deliberate <i>dénouement</i>. He was mysterious,
he was excited, when he went round the other night
to the Cathedral house. When he came here, he made
the most obvious attempts to try to behave as if
everything was going on just as usual. He made
fussy arrangements about being called in the
morning; he pretended to have left a letter half-finished;
he put a novel down by the bedside, wound up his
watch, put studs in his shirt—he did everything to
create the surface impression, good enough (he
thought) for the Coroner, that whatever else was
the truth suicide was out of the question. He made
one or two slips there—writing down his name in the
visitors’ book with a blank for his date of
departure, as if any guest ever did that; putting the
flies ready on his rod, but (so Pulteney tells me)
the wrong kind of flies. To make sure that there
was not a verdict of suicide, he even made
arrangements—through Brinkman, through Mrs. Davis, I
don’t know how—to have the gas in his bedroom
turned off again after it had done its work. Then he
tossed off his sleeping draught, turned the gas on,
and got into bed. I was sure of all that, even before
I went over to Pullford, before you got the telegram
from London. What I couldn’t understand was the
motive; and now that’s as plain as daylight. He was
determined to endow the Pullford Diocese with half
a million, so as to be sure of having his nest well
lined in the next world. He knew that Christian
morality doesn’t permit suicide, but he thought he
was all right, because he was only doing evil in order
that good might come of it. And so he got rid of the
spectre of a painful death from disease, and at the
same time made sure, he thought, of a welcome on
the other side, if there should prove to be an
eternity.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s your idea. I don’t deny it hangs
together. But it comes up against two things—fatally,
I think. If Mottram was so set upon endowing the
Pullford Diocese, why did he bequeath most of his
fortune to a footling Town Council and only leave
the diocese the one bit of money which, if a verdict
of suicide was given, could never be touched? And
granted that he was at pains to get some one to turn
off the gas for him, so as to avoid the appearance of
suicide, why did he tell that person to lock the door,
and leave the key on the wrong side? That’s the
problem you’ve set yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God knows, I don’t see my way clear yet.
But there’s the outlines of the thing. Now let’s hear
the <i>proxime accessit</i> solution.”</p>

<p>“I feel inclined to apologize. I feel ashamed of
being so right. But you’ve asked for it. Look here,
the thing which has complicated this case so badly
is the appearance of bluff. At one moment it looked
like suicide pretending to be accident or murder; at
another time it looked like murder pretending to be
suicide. But the great mountainous fact that stands
out is the turning off of the gas. In the event of
suicide, that was impossible; in the event of murder, it
was curiously needless. For it entirely removed the
possibility of a suicide verdict. It was only as I was
getting into bed last night that the truth flashed upon
me. The gas was turned off by a murderer
deliberately, and, mark this, in order to shew that the
murder was not suicide. It was a deliberate protest,
an advertisement. Make what you like of this case
(it seemed to say); but do not call it suicide; that
at least is outside the scheme of possibilities.”</p>

<p>“Well, my solution was rather by way of
allowing for that.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. But, you see, you involve yourself in
a hopeless psychological improbability. You make a
man commit suicide, leaving behind him an
accomplice who will turn off the gas. Now, it’s an
extraordinary thing, our human love of interference; but I
don’t believe it possible to have an accomplice in
suicide. Except, of course, for those ‘death pacts’
which we are all familiar with. Tell any one that you
mean to commit suicide and that person will not
only try to dissuade you but will scheme to prevent
your bringing the thing off. Suicide here would
involve an accomplice; therefore it was not suicide.
It was murder; and yet the murderer, so far from
wanting to make it appear suicide, was particularly
anxious to make it clear that it was <em>not</em> suicide.
There is a strange situation for you.</p>

<p>“The strange situations, the mysterious situations,
are not those which are most difficult to unravel.
You can proceed in this case to look for the
murderer in the certainty that he is some one who would
stand to lose if a verdict of suicide were brought in.
Puzzling it over last night I was unable to conceive
such a person. Between you and me, I had been
inclined to suspect Brinkman; but there did not seem
to be any possible reason why he should want to
murder Mottram; and, if he did, there was no
conceivable reason why he should want to make it
appear that Mottram did not commit suicide.
Brinkman was not the heir; the Euthanasia policy did not
affect him.</p>

<p>“My discoveries of this morning put me on an
entirely different track. There was one man in the
world, and only one, whose interest bade him
murder Mottram, and murder him in such a way that no
suspicion of suicide could rest over the event. I mean,
of course, young Simmonds. It was in his interest,
as he must have thought, to murder Mottram,
because if Mottram lived to be sixty-five the
Euthanasia policy would run out. This was Simmonds’s last
chance but one, assuming that Mottram’s yearly
visits to Chilthorpe were the best chance of doing
away with him. In two years from now Mottram
would have turned sixty-five and the half-million
would have vanished into the air. Moreover, there
was much to be said for haste: who could tell when
Mottram might not take it into his head to draw up
a new will? As it seemed to Simmonds, he had only
to get rid of this lonely, crusty old bachelor by a
painless death, and he, as the next of kin, would
walk straight into five hundred thousand.
Meanwhile, there must be no suspicion of suicide, for any
such suspicion might mean that your company would
refuse to pay up and the half-million would have
disappeared once more.</p>

<p>“To young Simmonds, as he let himself in by the
ground-floor casement into the <i>Load of Mischief</i>,
only one fear presented itself—the fear of a false
verdict. He was of the type that cannot commit
cold-blooded murder. The more civilization
advances the more ingenious does crime become;
meanwhile, it becomes more and more difficult for
one man to kill another with his hands. Simmonds
might have been a poisoner; as it was, he had
discovered a safer way: he would be a gasser. But there
was this defect about the weapon he was using—it
might create a false impression on the jury.
Imperative, then, not merely to kill his man but to prove
that he had killed him. That is why, after turning
on the gas in the sleeping man’s room, he waited for
two hours or so outside; then came back, flung open
the window to get air, and turned the gas off again,
only pausing to make sure that his victim was dead.</p>

<p>“How he worked the door trick I don’t know. We
shall find out later. Meanwhile, let me tell you that
one of the friends I made last night in the bar
parlour told me he had seen Simmonds hanging round
the hotel just after closing time, although (for the
fellow is a teetotaller) he had not been drinking
there. This was on the very night of the murder.
That was a point in which I was in a position to
score off you. There was another point, over which
you had the same opportunities of information, but
neglected them. You remember the letter which
Mottram left lying about in his bedroom? It was in
answer to a correspondent who signed himself
‘Brutus.’ I took the trouble to get from the offices
of the <i>Pullford Examiner</i> a copy of the issue in
which that letter appeared. It is a threatening letter,
warning Mottram that retribution would come upon
him for the bloodsucking methods by which his
money had been made. And it was signed ‘Brutus.’
You’ve had a classical education; you ought to have
spotted the point; personally I looked it up in an
encyclopædia. Brutus wasn’t merely a demagogue;
he led the revolt in Rome which resulted in the
expulsion of his own maternal uncle, King Tarquin.
The same relation, you see, that there was between
Simmonds and Mottram.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve applied for a warrant. I’m in no hurry
to use it; for, as long as Simmonds is off his guard,
he’s all the more likely to give himself away.
Meanwhile, I’m having him watched. If you go and talk
to him, just to form your own impressions, I know
you’ll be careful not to say anything which would
give away my suspicions. And I can wait for that
twenty pounds too.”</p>

<p>Bredon sat spellbound. He could see the whole
thing happening; he could trace every calculation in
the mind of the criminal. And yet he was not
convinced. He was just about to explain this, when a
fresh thought struck him and interfered with their
session. “Leyland,” he said, in a very quiet voice,
“you aren’t smoking, and I’ve had my pipe out these
last ten minutes. Can you tell me why there should
be a smell of cigarette smoke?”</p>

<p>Leyland looked round, suddenly on the alert. It
was only as he looked round that he noticed how
insecure was their privacy. The rain had stopped
some time since, and there was no reason why an
interloper should not be standing outside, listening
through one of the numerous chinks in the wall
behind them. Gripping Bredon’s arm, he darted out
suddenly, and rounded the corner of the building.
There was nobody there. But close to the wall lay a
cigarette-end, flattened and soiled as if it had been
trodden by a human foot. And as Leyland picked it
up a faint spark and a thin stream of smoke shewed
that it had been trodden on only a moment before,
not quite successfully. “Callipoli,” he read,
examining the stump. “Not the sort of cigarette one buys
in the village. It looks to me, Bredon, as if we were
on the track of something fresh here. We’ll leave
that cigarette-stump exactly where we found it.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br/> The Generalship of Angela</h2>

<p>“Angela,” said Bredon when he found her,
“I’ve got a job of work for you.”</p>

<p>“Such as?”</p>

<p>“All you’ve got to do is to make Brinkman and
Pulteney open their cigarette-cases for inspection
without knowing that they’re doing it.”</p>

<p>“Miles, it won’t do. You know I can’t work in
blinkers. There’s nothing I dislike so much as a want
of complete confidence between husband and wife.
Sit down and tell me all about it. You’d better make
sure of the door first.” And she turned down the little
shutter which protected their keyhole on the inside.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” said Bredon, and told the story
of their recent alarms. “It almost must be somebody
in the house. Brinkman and Pulteney are both
cigarette-smokers, and of course it would be easy
for me to cadge a cigarette by saying I’d run short.
But that just might put the mysterious gentleman on
his guard. And I don’t want to hang about picking
up fags. So what you’ve got to do is to lead round
the conversation in such a way that we can have an
opportunity of finding out what cigarettes each of
them smokes without his suspecting anything.”</p>

<p>“Why not pinch some from their rooms?”</p>

<p>“It might work. But since people took to smoking
all kinds of vile cigarettes at the end of the war,
one doesn’t trouble to carry one’s own brand about.
One buys them at the local shop. These Callipolis
are an oddity, but there probably aren’t many more
where they came from, and the safest place to look
for them is inside somebody’s breast-pocket.
Anyhow, you might try.”</p>

<p>“Sort of salted almonds game?” said Angela
reflectively. “All right, I will. Don’t you try your
hand at it; sit there and back me up. Meanwhile,
you’d better go down and have a pick-me-up at the
bar, because I’m going to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Dress for dinner, in a hole like this? Whatever
for?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand the technique of the thing.
If I’m to have complete control of the conversation,
I must be looking my best. It makes all the
difference with a susceptible old dear like Edward.”</p>

<p>She certainly had made herself look attractive, if
a trifle exotic, by the time she came downstairs. The
maid all but broke the soup-plates at the sight of her.</p>

<p>“Did you see much of Pullford, Mrs. Bredon?”
asked Brinkman, on hearing of their day’s
expedition.</p>

<p>“Much of it? Why, I’m practically a native of the
place by now. I shall never see a perambulator again,
I mean a drain-pipe, without a sort of homely feeling.
My husband left me alone for three solid hours while
he went and caroused with the hierarchy.”</p>

<p>“A very genial man, isn’t he, the Bishop,” said
Brinkman, appealing to her husband.</p>

<p>“What a poor compliment that word <i>genial</i> is,”
put in the old gentleman. “I would sooner be called
well-meaning, myself. You have no grounds for
saying that a man is really kind or charitable; you have
not personally found him attractive; and yet he has
a sort of good-natured way with him which demands
some tribute. So you say he is genial.”</p>

<p>“Like a Dickens character?” suggested Brinkman.</p>

<p>“No, they are too human to be called merely
genial. Mr. Pickwick genial! It is like calling the
day of judgment a fine sight. How did Pusey, by
the way, ever have the wit to light upon such a
comparison?”</p>

<p>“I think <i>witty</i> is rather a dreadful thing to be
called,” said Angela. “I always think of witty
people as people who dominate the conversation with
long anecdotes. How glad I am to have been born
into a world in which the anecdote has gone out of
fashion!”</p>

<p>“A hemisphere, Mrs. Bredon,” said Brinkman in
correction. “You have not been to America? The
anecdote there is in its first youth; the anecdotes
mostly in their extreme old age.”</p>

<p>“There is a pleasant dryness about American
humour,” objected Pulteney. “But I confess that I
miss piquancy in it.”</p>

<p>“Like Virginian tobacco?” suggested Bredon, and
was rewarded by a savage kick from Angela under
the table.</p>

<p>“The anecdote, however,” pursued Mr. Pulteney,
“is the enemy of conversation. With its appearance,
the shadow of egotism falls over our conviviality.
The man who hoards up anecdotes, and lets them
loose at intervals, is a social indecency; he might
as well strip and parade some kind of acrobatic
feat. See how your anecdotist lies in wait for his
opportunity, prays for the moment that will lend
excuse to his ‘That reminds me.’ There is a further
pitch of shamelessness at which such a man will
assault you openly with ‘Have you heard this one?’
But as long as men have some rags of behaviour left
to them your sex, Mrs. Bredon, saves us from this
conversational horror. When the ladies leave us,
anecdotes flow out as from a burst dam.”</p>

<p>“That’s because we don’t know how to tell stories;
we don’t drag them out enough. When I try to tell a
story I always find I have got to the point when
I’ve only just started.”</p>

<p>“You are too modest, Mrs. Bredon. It is your
essential altruism which preserves you. You women are
always for helping out the conversation, not
strangling it at birth. You humour us men, fool us to the
top of our bent, yet you always restrain conversation
from its worst extravagances—like a low organ
accompaniment you unobtrusively give us the note.
All praise to your unselfishness!”</p>

<p>“I expect we are trained that way, or have trained
ourselves that way. Civilization has taught us,
perhaps, to play up to the men.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no,” chirped Mr. Pulteney, now
thoroughly enjoying himself. “Conversational
receptivity is a natural glory of your sex. Nature itself,
which bids the peacock strut to the admiration of
the hen, bids you evoke the intellectual powers of
the male. You flatter him by your attention and he
basks unconsciously in your approval. How much
more knowledge of human nature had Virgil than
Homer! Alcinous would never have got all that long
story out of Ulysses; challenged by a direct
question the hero would probably have admitted, in a
gruff voice, that he had been fooling around
somewhere. It was a Dido that was needed to justify
the hysteron proteron—‘Multa super Priamo
rogitans, super Hectore multa’—she knew how to do
it! But I become lyrical.”</p>

<p>“Do please be lyrical, Mr. Pulteney. It’s so good
for Miles; he thinks he’s a strong, silent man, and
there’s nothing more odious. The trouble is, of
course, he thinks he’s a kind of detective, and he
has to play up to the part. Look at you, Mr. Leyland,
you’ve hardly uttered.”</p>

<p>“Is this helping us out in conversation, Mrs.
Bredon? You seem to be flogging us into it.”</p>

<p>“The strong silence of the detective,” explained
the old gentleman, “is a novelists’ fiction. The
novelist must gag his detective, or how is he to preserve
his secret till the last chapter? No, it is Mr.
Brinkman who should be professionally silent; for what
is a secretary if he does not keep secrets?”</p>

<p>“I am not silent, I am silenced,” said Brinkman.
“The second best peacock dare not strut for fear of
an encounter.”</p>

<p>“I find in silence,” said Bredon, “a mere relief
from the burden of conversation. I am grateful to
the man who talks, as I should be grateful to the
man who jumped in before me to rescue a drowning
baby. He obviates the necessity for effort on my part.
I sometimes think that is why I married.”</p>

<p>“Miles,” said Angela, “if you are going to be
odious, you will have to leave the room. I suppose
you think you can be rude because the detectives in
fiction are rude? Mr. Leyland may be silent, but at
least he’s polite.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bredon is married,” suggested Pulteney.
“The caged bird does not strut. His are golden
chains, I hasten to add, but they take the spring out
of him none the less. For all that, I have some
contempt for the man who does not take his share in
shouldering the burden of conversation. He puts
nothing into the common pot. Mr. Brinkman, I
resign the strutting-ground. Tell us whether you think
detectives should be strong, silent men or not.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I haven’t read much in that direction,
Mr. Pulteney. I should imagine it was an
advantage to the detective to be silent, so that he can be
in a good position to say ‘I told you so’ when the
truth comes out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but a detective ought to be talking all the
time,” protested Angela. “The ones in the books
always are. Only what they say is always entirely
incomprehensible, both to the other people in the
book and to the reader. ‘Let me call your attention
once more,’ they say; ‘to the sinister significance of
the bend in the toast-rack,’ and there you are, none
the wiser. Wouldn’t you like to be a detective, Mr.
Pulteney?”</p>

<p>“Why, in a sense I am.” There was a slight pause,
with several mental gasps in it, till the old
gentleman continued, “That is to say, I am a
schoolmaster; and the two functions are nearly akin. Who
threw the butter at the ceiling, which boy cribbed
from which, where the missing postage-stamp has
got to—these are the problems which agitate my
inglorious old age. I do not know why headmasters
allow boys to collect postage-stamps; they are
invariably stolen.”</p>

<p>“Or why anybody wants to collect them?”
suggested Angela. “Some of them are quite pretty, of
course. But I’ve no patience with all this pedantry
about the exact date of issue and the exact shape of
the water-mark. But I suppose the water-mark
helps you in your investigations, Mr. Pulteney?”</p>

<p>“I am hardly professional enough for that. I leave
that to the philatelist. A philatelist, by the way,
means one who loves the absence of taxes. It hardly
seems to mark out the stamp-lover from his fellows.”</p>

<p>“The detectives of fiction,” put in Leyland, “are
always getting important clues from the water-mark
of the paper on which some cryptic document is
written, That is where they have the luck. If you
pick up the next four pieces of paper you see, and
hold them up to the light, you will probably find
that three of them have no water-mark at all.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Angela. “And I used to be told,
when I was small, that every genuine piece of silver
had a lion stamped on it. But of course they haven’t
really. I should think it’s quite likely the
wrist-watch you gave me, Miles dear, has no lion on it.”
She took it off as she spoke. “Or it must be a
teeny-weeny one if there is.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re wrong there, Mrs. Bredon.” It was
Brinkman who offered the correction. “If you’ll
allow me to have a look at it. . . . There, up there;
it’s a little rubbed away, but it’s a lion all right.”</p>

<p>“I thought there always was a lion,” said Bredon,
taking out a silver pencil-case with some presence of
mind. “Yes, this has got two, one passant and one
cabinet size.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see your watch, Mr. Leyland,” suggested
Angela, “or is it electro?”</p>

<p>“It should be silver; yes, there’s the little chap.”
Immediately afterward, Angela was rewarded by
seeing Pulteney take a silver cigarette-case out of
his pocket, and handing it over to her. “It’ll be on
the inside of this, I suppose? Oh, no, it’s all gilt
stuff; yes, I see, here it is on the outside.” It is to
be feared that she added “Damn!” under her breath;
the cigarette-case had been empty.</p>

<p>“I seem to be the only poor man present,” said
Brinkman; “I am all gun-metal.”</p>

<p>Angela did not trouble to influence the
conversation further until the “shape” course was finished.
Then, rather desperately, she said, “Do smoke, Mr.
Leyland, I know you’re dying to. What is a
detective without his shag?” and was rewarded by seeing
Brinkman take out the gun-metal case and light up.
Mr. Pulteney, after verifying his own
cigarettelessness, began slowly to fill a briar.</p>

<p>Brinkman’s cigarette, she had seen, was the last
in the case; what if it should be the last of its box or
of its packet? “I wish I smoked,” she said. “But if
I did I would smoke a pipe; it always looks so
comfortable. Besides, you can shut your eyes and go to
sleep with a pipe, which must be rather dangerous
with a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“You’d lose the taste of the pipe if you did,”
objected Brinkman. “It’s an extraordinary thing, how
little satisfaction you can get out of smoking in the
dark.”</p>

<p>“Is that really true? I’ve always heard that about
taste depending on sight, and not being able to
distinguish one wine from another with one’s eyes shut.
Miles, if I put a handkerchief over your eyes, could
you tell your beer from Mr. Brinkman’s cider? Oo,
I say, let’s try! I’ll give them you in spoonfuls.”</p>

<p>“I’ll shut my eyes, but play fair,” suggested
Bredon. The idiocy of men!</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, you’ll do what you’re told.
Anybody got a clean hanky? Thank you so much, Mr.
Leyland. . . . There, that’s right. Now, open your
mouth, but not too wide, or you’ll choke. . . .
Which was that?”</p>

<p>“Cider, I thought.”</p>

<p>“It was vinegar, really, with a little water in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, that’s not fair.” Miles tore away
the handkerchief from his eyes. “Hang it all, I
won’t strut; I’m a married man!”</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Brinkman shall try instead; you will,
won’t you, Mr. Brinkman?” It is to be feared that
Angela favoured him with an appealing look; at any
rate, he succumbed. With the instinct of the
blindfolded man, he put his cigarette down on the edge
of his plate. It was easy work for Angela to drop
the spoon, and set Mr. Pulteney grovelling for it.
Meanwhile, she hastily picked up Brinkman’s
cigarette, and read the word “Callipoli.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XII. <br/> The Makings of a Trap</h2>

<p>It was Bredon and Leyland, this time, who took
their evening walk together. To Bredon, events
seemed to be closing in like a nightmare. Here
was he pledged to uphold the theory of suicide; and
he had depended largely for his success on Leyland’s
inability to produce a suitable candidate for the
position of murderer. But now there seemed to be a
perfect <i>embarras</i> of murderers. Macbeth wasn’t in it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “at least we have something
positive to go upon now. Brinkman’s part in this
business may be what you will, but he certainly takes an
unhealthy interest in it, to the extent of hanging
about round corners where he’s no business to be.
At least we can confront him with his behaviour,
and encourage him to make a clean breast of the
whole thing. I imagine you will have no objection
to that, since it’s not Brinkman you suspect of the
murder?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Leyland, “that’s not the way
we go to work. The force, I mean. It’s quite true
Brinkman is not the man I have under suspicion at
the moment, but I’m only working on a theory, and
that theory may prove to be a false one. I’m not
certain of it yet, and I should have to be certain of
it before I acquitted Brinkman.”</p>

<p>“But, hang it all, look at the question of motive.
Simmonds, I grant you, had a reasonable motive
for wanting to make away with his uncle. He had
grounds for thinking that his uncle’s death would
mean a clear half-million to him. He had quarrelled
with his uncle, and thought he had been treated
badly. He disapproved of his uncle, and regarded
him as a bloodsucker. The fact that Mottram was
down at Chilthorpe was an excellent opportunity,
and a rare opportunity, for young Simmonds to get
at him. Seldom the time and the place and the hated
one all together. But your Brinkman, as far as we
can see, was only affected by the death in the sense
that he has lost a good job and has now to look out
for another one, with no late employer to supply
him with testimonials. Personally, I believe
Brinkman did know about the alteration in the will; at
least he knew about the uncertainty of Mottram’s
health. Can you suppose that, even if Simmonds
offered to go halves with him, he would consent to
be an accomplice in what might prove a wholly
unnecessary crime?”</p>

<p>“You’re assuming too much. We don’t know yet
that Brinkman has no financial interest in the
affair. Look here—this is far-fetched, I grant you, but
it’s not impossible: Everybody says Mottram had
no family; whose word have they for that except
his own? Where did he pick up Brinkman? No one
knows. Why did he want a secretary? There was
some talk of writing a history of Pullford, but
nothing ever came of it. Why, then, this curious
interest which Mottram takes in Brinkman? I don’t
say it’s likely, but I say it’s possible that Brinkman
is Mottram’s son by a clandestine marriage. If
that’s so, and if Brinkman didn’t know about the
codicil, he may himself be the next of kin who is
preparing to step into the half-million. And a clever
man—Brinkman is a clever man—might find it
convenient to get Mottram out of the way, and get
some one else to do it for him. He is afraid that
Mottram will live to be sixty-five, and the policy
will leave no benefits behind it. Or he is afraid that
Mottram is going to make a new will. What does
he do? Why, he goes to Simmonds, and points out
to him that as the next of kin he would score by
putting Mottram through it. Simmonds does so,
all unsuspecting; and here’s Brinkman, only
waiting to step in and claim the half-million on the
strength of his mother’s marriage-lines!”</p>

<p>“You’re too confoundedly ingenious. Things don’t
happen like that.”</p>

<p>“Things have happened like that before now, and
with less than half a million to give grounds for
them. No, I’m not going to leave Brinkman out of
my calculations, and therefore I’m not going to
take him into my confidence. But this
eavesdropping of his does give us a very important chance,
and we’re going to use it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see how.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re not a professional, and
you don’t know the way things are done in the force.
The outside public doesn’t, and we don’t mean it
to. We don’t show our workings. But half, or say a
third at least, of the big businesses we clear up are
cleared up by bluff, by leading the suspected man
on and encouraging him to give himself away.
Sometimes it isn’t a very pretty business, of course; we
have to use agents who are none too scrupulous.
But here we’ve got a ready-made chance of bluffing
our man, and bluffing him into betraying himself.”</p>

<p>“How, exactly?”</p>

<p>“You and I are going to meet again in that
mill-house. And we are going to talk about it openly
beforehand, so that we can be jolly sure Brinkman
will creep up behind and listen to us. And when
we’ve got him comfortably fixed there listening to
us, you and I are going to lead him up the garden.
We are going to make him overhear something
which is really meant for his ears, though he thinks
it’s meant for anybody’s ears rather than his own.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see—a fake conversation. I say, I’m not
much of an actor. Angela would do it far better than
I should.”</p>

<p>“There’s no acting wanted. All you’ve got to do
is to sit there and argue pigheadedly about it’s being
suicide, the same as you always do. Meanwhile,
I’ll do the fake part—or rather, it won’t be much
of a fake, either. I shall repeat what I told you
yesterday, about suspecting Simmonds. That’s all
true enough; I do suspect the man; though I wish
he wasn’t so confoundedly innocent and self-possessed
under examination. Then I shall say that
I also suspect Brinkman—not letting on, of course,
about the cigarette and all that, but putting up
some ground or other for suspicion. Simmonds, I
shall say, is clearly the murderer, but I’ve reason
to think Brinkman knows more about it than he
ought to do. I shall say that I’m going to have
Brinkman shadowed, and that I’m going to get a
warrant for his arrest. At the same time, I shall
say I think he’s a fool not to own up, if his share
in the business is not a guilty one. And so on.
Then we just wait and see how Brinkman reacts.”</p>

<p>“I should think he’d skip.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want him to do. Of course, I’ve
got him shadowed already. If he makes a determined
bolt for it that gives me reasonable ground for
putting him under arrest.”</p>

<p>“What else can he do?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s relatively innocent, he might
confide in you about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, that’s the game. Damn it, why did I
ever consent to become a spy? Leyland, I don’t like
this job. It’s too—too underhand.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were an intelligence officer, weren’t
you? There was no trick you wouldn’t play, while
the war was on, to beat the Germans. Why should
you be more squeamish about it when you’ve the
well-being of society to consider? Your job is to
protect the interests of all the honest men who’ve
insured with your company. My business is to see
that harmless people don’t get gassed in their sleep.
In any case, we’ve got to get at the truth. I might
even point out that we’ve got a bet on it.”</p>

<p>“But look here, if Brinkman confides in me, am
I to betray his confidence? That hardly seems
cricket.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re not a fool, you’d better avoid
making any promise of secrecy. You must act up
to your own confounded conscience, I suppose. But
remember, Brinkman can’t get away; I’ve got him
watched all right. If his part in the show is quite an
innocent one, you’d better point out to him that his
best plan is to make a clean breast of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll help you bait the trap. If Brinkman
comes to me about it, I can’t answer for what I’ll
do—unless you subpœna me, of course. By the
way, what happens if Brinkman doesn’t react at
all? If he simply does nothing about it?”</p>

<p>“We shall be just where we were before. But I
think if we give him a lead he’s almost certain to
take it. After all, there’s no reason why he should
stay on here, but he hasn’t shown any signs of
moving yet. Once the funeral’s over, he’ll be anxious
to put things straight, if only to get a fresh job.”</p>

<p>By now they were on their return journey, on
the road leading down the valley; the twilight was
gathering, but the few street-lamps which Chilthorpe
afforded had not yet been lit. It was but natural
that on a summer evening such a road as this should
be a trysting-place of lovers. There is a sentimental
streak in all our natures which warns us that a
young man and a young woman sharing a railway
carriage must be left to share it; and equally that
a pair of lovers in a lane must be passed by as
hastily as possible, with no inquisitive looks thrown
in their direction. It is our instinct thus to
propitiate the Paphian Queen. It was characteristic
of Bredon that, as he passed one of these couples
from behind, seeing their heads close together in
earnest colloquy, he quickened his pace and never
looked backward. It was equally characteristic of
Leyland that, although he too quickened his pace,
he did let his eye rest on the pair for a
moment—lightly, it seemed, and uncomprehendingly. But
when they were out of earshot he shewed that his
had been no casual glance. “You saw them, Bredon,
eh? You saw them?”</p>

<p>“I saw there were some people there. I didn’t”——</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t. But it doesn’t do to miss these
things. The young lady is the barmaid at our hotel,
the lady who always says ‘Raight-ho!’ when you ask
for anything. And the young man is our friend Mr.
Simmonds. It looks as if a <i>mésalliance</i> were in
contemplation, from the Simmonds point of view. And
it means—well, it may mean almost anything.”</p>

<p>“Or almost nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me, it seems to be a matter
of importance to know that Simmonds has got his
foot inside the door, so to speak, at the <i>Load of
Mischief</i>. He had somebody there to let him in and
let him out late at night. He had somebody to cover
his traces, if necessary, when the crime was over.
I think our nets are beginning to close at last.”</p>

<p>“Like to hide behind the hedge and listen to what
they’re saying?”</p>

<p>“Why, it might be done. But it seemed to me
they had their voices lowered all the time, not
merely while we were passing. No, I think it’s the
bar parlour for me.”</p>

<p>Angela was far more enthusiastic than her
husband over the proposed ambush. “You see, Brinky
can’t really be a very nice man, or he wouldn’t have
been listening at our keyhole. Just think, I might
have been ticking you off about your table manners
or something. No, if he will go and hide in the
arras he must take what he gets, like Polonius. And,
after all, if he does come to you afterward, and
wants to sob on your bosom, you can always refuse
to promise secrecy. The world would be such a
much happier place if people wouldn’t make
promises.”</p>

<p>“None at all?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be soppy. You aren’t in the lovers’ lane
now. Meanwhile, I think it would be a good thing
if you overcame your natural bonhomie, and had a
talk with Mr. Simmonds to-morrow. The more
necessary, since you only seem to have brought three
hankies here, and it’s you for the haberdasher’s
in any case.”</p>

<p>“All right; but you mustn’t come. You cramp
my style in shops. Too much of the
I-want-a-handkerchief-for-this-young-gentleman business about
you.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall console myself by talking to the
barmaid, and finding out if she’s capable of saying
anything except ‘Raight-ho.’ Of course I knew she
had a young man all the time.”</p>

<p>“Rot! How could you tell?”</p>

<p>“My dear Miles, no girl ever waits so badly as
that, or tosses her head like that, unless she’s
meaning to chuck up her job almost immediately. I
deduced a young man.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you haven’t wormed yourself into her
confidence already.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t interested in her. But to-night, at
supper, she was jumpy—even you must have noticed
it. She almost dropped the soup-plates, and the
‘shape’ was quivering like a guilty thing surprised.”</p>

<p>“That was your dressing for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Bunkum! You must have seen that she was all
on edge. Anyhow, we’re going to have a
heart-to-heart talk.”</p>

<p>“All right. Don’t bully the wretched girl, though.”</p>

<p>“Miles! You really mustn’t go running after every
woman you meet like this. I shall deal with her
with all my well-known delicacy and tact. Look how
I managed them at supper! I should have cried, I
think, if I’d found it was Edward who smoked the
Callipoli. Do you think Leyland has still got his
knife into Simmonds? Or do you think he wants to
arrest Brinky, and is only using Simmonds as a
blind?”</p>

<p>“He was excited enough when we met Simmonds
in the lane. No, I think he’s out to arrest
everybody at the moment; Simmonds for doing the
murder, and Brinkman for persuading him or helping
him to do it. He’s got ’em both shadowed, anyhow,
he says—I hope not by the Chilthorpe police, who
look to me too substantial to be mistaken for
shadows. But I’m sure I’m right, I’m sure I’m
right.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are. Though, mind you, it looks
to me as if Mottram had only just managed to
commit suicide in time to avoid being murdered. The
trouble about Leyland’s Simmonds theory is that
it makes the little man too clever. I don’t believe
Leyland could ever catch a criminal unless he were
a superhumanly clever criminal, and of course so
few of them are. They go and make one rotten little
mistake, and so get caught out.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting too clever. It’s quite time you
went to bed.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Raight-ho,’ as your friend the barmaid says.
No, don’t stamp about and pretend to be a
caveman. Go downstairs like a good boy, and help
Leyland incriminate the oldest inhabitant. He’ll be
getting to that soon.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br/> A Morning with the Haberdasher</h2>

<p>The sun rose bright the next morning, as if it
had heard there was a funeral in contemplation
and was determined to be there. The
party at the <i>Load of Mischief</i> rose considerably
later, and more or less coincided at the breakfast
table. “I am afraid we shall be losing you,” said
Mr. Pulteney to Angela. “A fortunate crime
privileged us with your presence; when the mortal
remains of it have been put away I suppose that your
husband’s work here is done? Unless, of course,
Mrs. Davis’s eggs and bacon have determined you
to stay on here as a holiday.”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know what we are doing, Mr.
Pulteney. My husband, of course, will have to write
a report for those tiresome people at the office, and
that will take a little time. Why do men always take
a whole day to write a report? I don’t suppose we
shall be leaving till to-morrow in any case. Perhaps
you will have caught a fish by then.”</p>

<p>“If you would only consent to stay till that
happens we should all congratulate ourselves. But,
seriously, it will be a deprivation. I came to this hotel
feeling that I was foredoomed to solitude, or the
company, now and again, of a stray bagman.
Instead, I have found the place a feast of reason; and
I shall regret the change.”</p>

<p>“You’ll still have Mr. Brinkman.”</p>

<p>“What is Brinkman? A man who cannot tell beer
from cider with his eyes shut—Ah, here he is! I
have been lamenting the loss Mr. and Mrs. Bredon
will be to our desert island. But you too, I suppose,
will be for Pullford again before the funeral
bake-meats are cold?”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I don’t know. . . . My plans are
rather vague. The house at Pullford is almost shut
up, everybody except the housekeeper away. I
daresay I shall stay on a bit. And then, I suppose, go to
London to look for another job.”</p>

<p>“With better auspices, I hope. Well, you deserve a
rest before you settle down to the collar again.
Talking of collars” (he addressed himself to the
barmaid, who had just come in with more eggs and
bacon), “I wonder if you could represent to Mrs.
Davis the desirability of sending some of my clothes
to the wash?”</p>

<p>“Raight-ho,” said the barmaid, unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“I thank you; you gratify my least whim. Ah,
here is Mr. Leyland! I trust you have slept off the
weariness induced by the Coroner’s allocution
yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Quite, thanks,” said Leyland, grinning.
“Good-morning, Mrs. Bredon. Good-morning, Bredon; I
wonder if you could give me ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour after breakfast? . . . No, no
porridge, thanks; just eggs and bacon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather. We might stroll back to the
mill-house, if you don’t mind, for I rather think I
dropped a packet of pipe-papers there. In fact, I
think I’ll go on there and wait for you. No hurry.”</p>

<p>It was some twenty minutes before Leyland
turned up, and almost at the moment of his arrival
both men heard a very faint click behind them, as if
somebody on the further side of the wall, in walking
gently, had dislodged a loose stone. They exchanged
an instantaneous glance, then Leyland opened up
the pre-arranged conversation. There was something
curiously uncanny about this business of talking
entirely for the benefit of a concealed audience, but
they both carried off the situation creditably.</p>

<p>“Well,” began Bredon, “you’re still hunting for
murderers?”</p>

<p>“For a murderer, to be accurate. It doesn’t take
two men to turn on a gas-jet. And when I say I’m
hunting for him, I’m not exactly doing that; I’m
hunting him. The motive’s clear enough, and the
method’s clear enough, apart from details, but I
want to make my case a little stronger before I take
any action.”</p>

<p>“You’ve applied for a warrant, you say?”</p>

<p>“Against Simmonds, yes. At least, I wrote last
night; though of course with the posts we have here
it won’t reach London till this evening, and probably
late this evening. Meanwhile, I keep him under
observation.”</p>

<p>“You’re still sure he’s your man?”</p>

<p>“I can hardly imagine a stronger case. There’s
the motive present, and a good motive too, half a
million pounds. There’s the disposition, a natural
resentment against his uncle for treating him hardly,
added to a conscientious objection to his great
wealth and the means by which he made it. There’s
the threat: that letter of ‘Brutus’ will tell in a law
court, if I know anything of juries. There’s the
occasion: the fact of Mottram happening to be down
at Chilthorpe. There’s the facility: we know that he
was hand in glove with the barmaid, who could let
him in at any hour of the day or night, who could
further his schemes and cover his traces. Finally,
there is the actual coincidence of his whereabouts: I
can bring testimony to prove that he was hanging
round the <i>Load of Mischief</i> at a time when all
honest teetotallers ought to be in bed. There’s only one
thing more that I want, and only one thing on the
other side that would make me hold my hand.”</p>

<p>“What’s the one thing you want?”</p>

<p>“Definite evidence to connect him with the actual
room in which Mottram was sleeping. If he’d
dropped anything there, so much as a match-head;
if he’d left even a finger-mark about anywhere, I’d
have the noose round his neck. But if you haven’t
got just that last detail of evidence juries are often
slow to convict. I could tell you of murderers who
are at large now simply because we couldn’t actually
connect them with the particular scene of the crime
or with the particular weapon the crime was
committed with.”</p>

<p>Bredon could not help admiring the man. It was
obvious that he was still allowing for the possibility
of Brinkman’s guilt and was accordingly advising
Brinkman, whom he knew to be hidden round the
corner, to manufacture some clue which would point
to Simmonds, and thereby to give himself away.
Bredon could not help wondering whether this was
the real purpose of the colloquy, and whether he
himself was not being kept in the dark. However,
he had his sailing orders, and continued to play up to
them.</p>

<p>“And the one thing which would make you hold
your hand?”</p>

<p>“Why, if I could get satisfactory proof that
Simmonds knew of the existence of that codicil. You see,
we know that Simmonds did not stand to gain
anything by murdering his uncle, because, in fact, his
uncle had signed away all his expectations to the
Bishop of Pullford. Now, if I could feel certain that
Simmonds knew where he stood; knew that there
was nothing coming to him as next of kin—why,
then the motive would be gone, and with the motive
my suspicions. The fact that he disliked his uncle,
the fact that he disapproved of his uncle, wouldn’t
make him murder his uncle. It’s a humiliating fact,
but you don’t ever get a crime of this sort without
some <i>quid pro quo</i> in the form of hard cash. If I felt
sure that Simmonds knew he was cut out of the will
altogether, then I’d acquit him, or be prepared to
acquit him. If, on the other hand, somebody could
produce good reason for thinking that Simmonds
was expecting to profit by his uncle’s will, then
my case would be proportionately strengthened.”</p>

<p>Once more Bredon listened with admiration. The
man who was concealed behind the wall had been
Mottram’s own secretary, more likely than any other
man living to know how the facts stood. And
Leyland was appealing to him, if he had any relevant
knowledge about Simmonds’s expectations, to
produce it; if he had none, to forge it, and thereby give
himself away. The game began to thrill him in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>“And meanwhile, what of our other friend?”</p>

<p>“Brinkman? Well, as I told you, I don’t suspect
Brinkman directly. He had no motive for the crime,
as far as we can see. But he is not playing the game,
and for the life of me I can’t think why. For
instance, he has been ready from the first to back up
your idea of suicide. In fact, it seems to have been
he who first mentioned the word suicide in connexion
with this business. He told you, for example, that
he thought Dr. Ferrers must have shut off the main
gas-jet by accident. He said, I think you told me, that
it was very loose. As a matter of fact, it was very
stiff at the time, and he must have known that it
was stiff; for it was he who borrowed a pair of
pinchers for me when I wanted to loosen it. And there
are some other bits of evidence which I’m afraid I’m
not at liberty to mention to you, which make me look
askance at Brinkman’s behaviour. He’s hiding
something, but what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what good he can be doing himself
by holding back.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I don’t want to injure the fellow, but
I must get at the truth. I’m writing to-night for a
warrant; not because I think he’s the guilty man
but because we must get his evidence somehow, and
I think a taste of prison detention might make him
speak out. But of course it’s bad luck on the fellow,
because a record like that, however much he is
cleared, is bound to count against him when he looks
out for a new job. It’s possible that he’s shielding
Mottram’s reputation, or it’s possible that he’s
afraid of coming under suspicion himself, or it’s
possible that he’s simply lost his head, and, having
no one to consult, can’t make up his mind what to
do. But he’s cutting his own throat; there’s no doubt
about that. I can’t think he’s really guilty, or why
hasn’t he skipped? For all we could do, he could be
in Vienna in a couple of days, and we none the
wiser. Yet he stays on, and stays on as if there
was some end to be gained by it.”</p>

<p>“But if he went off you could arrest him on
suspicion, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Could I? Hardly on what I know at present. I’m
looking forward, you see, to Simmonds’s evidence
when he’s arrested. I know that type, anæmic,
nervous; once he’s arrested, with any luck, we can make
him tell us the whole story; and then, if Brinkman
really has been up to anything, it will be too late
for him to get clear. But, as I say, I don’t believe
Brinkman is a wrong ’un. If only he’d have the
sense to confide in me—or in you, if he’s afraid of
the police. . . . Well, I wanted to tell you all this,
so that you’ll know where you are in dealing with
Simmonds. Mrs. Bredon told me you were hoping to
get a look at him to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea. To tell the truth, I think I’d
better be starting now, because it’s easier to have
a private interview with him if I go into the shop
before the rush hour begins. Not that the rush hour
at Chilthorpe is likely to be very formidable, but I
don’t want to have our <i>tête-à-tête</i> interrupted by old
ladies matching ribbons.”</p>

<p>Bredon strolled off. Leyland stayed where he was
till he guessed the coast would be clear, and then
went cautiously round to the back of the building.
He found what he had expected, and hoped for. The
cigarette, which they had left the night before in
the place where it lay, had by now been carefully
removed.</p>

<p>When Bredon reached the shop he found that
Fortune was smiling on him. There seemed to be only
one attendant about besides Simmonds himself, and
this was a freckled, sandy-haired youth who was
cleaning the front windows with every appearance of
deliberation. Nor were there any rival shoppers so
early on a Chilthorpe morning. Mr. Simmonds
approached the handkerchief question with the air of
being just the right man to come to. Other things,
you felt, were to be bought in this shop: teethers,
for example, and walking-sticks, and liquorice, and
so on. But when you came to <em>handkerchiefs</em>, there
you had found a specialist, a man who had handled
handkerchiefs these fifteen years past. Something
stylish, perhaps, was required? This with a glance
at the customer, as if to size him up and recognise
the man of taste. “The <em>plain</em> ones? Just plain white,
you mean, sir? Well, it’s a curious thing, but I’m
not certain I can lay my hand on one of them. You
see, there’s more demand for the coloured ones, a
bit of edging, anyhow. And, you see, we haven’t
got in our new stock yet.” (They never have got in
their new stock yet at Simmonds’s.) “Three weeks
ago I could have done you a very good line in the
plain ones, but I’m rather afraid we’re right out.
I’ll just see.”</p>

<p>This was followed by an avalanche of drawers,
containing handkerchiefs of every conceivable
variety that was not plain. A violent horseshoe pattern
that ran through all the gamut of the colours; a
kind of willow pattern; a humorous series featuring
film stars; striped edges, spotted edges, check
edges—but no plain. From time to time Mr. Simmonds
would draw attention to the merits of the exhibits,
as if it were just his luck that his customer should
be a man so unadventurous in taste. “Now, that’s
a very good number; you couldn’t get a better line
than that, not if it was a coloured handkerchief you
were wanting. . . . No, no, sir, no trouble at all;
I daresay perhaps I may be able to lay my hand on
the article you require. . . . You don’t fancy those,
now? Those come very cheap because they’re
bankrupt stock. Just you feel that, sir, and see what a lot
of wear there is in it! . . . Yes, that’s right, they’re
a little on the gay side, sir, but we don’t get any
real demand, not for the plain ones; people don’t
seem to fancy them nowadays. Mind you, if you’ll
be staying on here for a day or two, I could get you
some; we shall be sending into Pullford the day
after to-morrow. But at the moment we seem to be
right out of them. . . . Oh, you’ll take the check
ones . . . half a dozen? Thank you, sir; you’ll find
they’re a very good line; you could go a long way
and not find another handkerchief just like that one.
It’s a handkerchief we’ve stocked many years now,
and never had any difficulty in getting rid of it. And
the next article, please?”</p>

<p>But Bredon did not meditate any more purchases.
He had begun to realize that in Chilthorpe you
bought not the thing you wanted but the thing Mr.
Simmonds had in stock. While the handkerchiefs
were being wrapped, he sat down on a high,
uncomfortable chair close to the counter, and opened
conversation about the deceased. Simmonds might
have quarrelled with his uncle, but surely he would
take the gloomy pride of the uneducated in his near
relationship to a corpse.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ve had a sad loss, Mr.
Simmonds.”</p>

<p>Now, why did the man suddenly turn a white,
haggard face toward his visitor, starting as if the
remark had been something out of the way? There
was no secret about the relationship; it had been
mentioned publicly at the inquest. Leyland had
insisted that in all his interviews with Simmonds he
had failed to observe any sign of discomposure. Yet
this morning a mere allusion to Mottram seemed to
throw his nephew all out of gear. The cant phrases
of his craft had flowed from him mechanically
enough, but once his customer began to talk the
gossip of the village all the self-possession fell from
him like a mask, and he stood pale and quivering.</p>

<p>“As you say, sir. Very melancholy event. My
uncle, sir, he was. Oh, yes, sir. We didn’t see him
much down here—we hadn’t anything to do with
him, sir. We didn’t get on very well—what I mean
is, he didn’t think much of me. No, sir. But he was
my uncle, sir. Over in Pullford he lived; hasn’t
lived here for many years now, though it was his
own place.”</p>

<p>“Still, blood’s thicker than water, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What’s that, sir? Oh, I see what you mean; yes,
sir. I’m seeing to the funeral and all that. Excuse me
one moment, sir. Sam! Just take a pair of steps and
put them boxes back, there’s a good lad. And there’s
nothing else to-day, sir?”</p>

<p>There was nothing else. Bredon had meant to say
a good deal, but he had reckoned on dealing with a
smug, self-possessed tradesman, who might
unsuspectingly drop a few hints that were worth knowing.
Instead, he found a man who started at shadows,
who was plainly alive with panic. He went back to
his hotel full of disquiet; there went his twenty
pounds, and the company’s half-million. And yet,
what did it all mean? Why did Simmonds tremble in
the presence of Bredon when he had shewn no trace
of embarrassment in talking to Leyland, who was
an official of the police? The whole tangle of events
seemed to become more complicated with every
effort that was made to unravel it.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br/> Bredon Is Taken for a Walk</h2>

<p>In front of the <i>Load of Mischief</i> stands an
ale-house bench—that is the description which
leaps to the mind. Ideally, it should be occupied
by an old gaffer in a white smock, drinking cider
and smoking a churchwarden. A really progressive
hotel would hire a gaffer by the day to do it. A less
appropriate advertisement, yet creditable enough to
the establishment in the bright air of the June
morning, Angela was occupying this seat as her husband
came back from his shopping; she was knitting in
a nice, old-fashioned way, but spoilt the effect of
it rather by whistling as she did so.</p>

<p>“Well, did you get a bargain?” she asked.</p>

<p>“So I am assured. I have got a very good line; I
could go a long way and not find another
handkerchief just like this one. Or indeed six other
handkerchiefs just like these six. They are distinctive,
that is the great point. Even you, Angela, will have
difficulty in getting them lost at the wash.”</p>

<p>“And how was Mr. Simmonds?” asked Angela,
dropping her voice.</p>

<p>Bredon looked round cautiously. But Angela had
chosen her place well; she knew that publicity is the
surest safeguard of privacy. In the open square in
front of the inn nobody would suppose that you
were exchanging anything but trivialities. Bredon
communicated his mystification and his alarm,
depicting the strange behaviour of that haberdasher
in terms that left no room for doubt.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Angela when he had finished, “you
were quite right not to press him with any more
questions. You do seem to be rather heavy-handed,
somehow, over these personal jobs. Now, I’ve been
having it out with ‘Raight-ho’ since breakfast, and
I got quite a lot out of her. Miles, that girl’s a jewel.
If she wasn’t going to be married, I’d get her to
come to Burrington, in spite of your well-known
susceptibility. But it’s no use; the poor girl is
determined to sign away her liberty.”</p>

<p>“To Mr. Simmonds?”</p>

<p>“So I gather from what Mr. Leyland told me last
night. But of course I was far too discreet to ask
for any names.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage to worm yourself into her
confidence? I’d as soon tackle a stone wall.”</p>

<p>“One must unbend. It’s easier for us women. By a
sudden inspiration, I reflected that it must be an
awful nuisance washing up all those plates after
breakfast, especially in a pub where they seldom
have more than two guests at a time. So I offered
to help. That was just about the time you went out
shopping. I’m quite good at washing up plates, you
know, thanks to having married beneath me. She
said ‘Raight-ho,’ and we adjourned to the scullery,
where I did wonders. In the scullery I saw a copy
of <i>Home Hints</i>, which was very important.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see why.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember that cantankerous old
bachelor friend of yours who came to us once in
London—Soames, I think his name was—who told
us that he wrote the column headed ‘Cupid’s
Labyrinth’? The column that gives advice to
correspondents, you know, about affairs of the heart. It’s the
greatest mistake in the world to suppose that the
modern pillion-girl is any less soppy about her
amours than the young misses of last century. I
knew instinctively that ‘Raight-ho’—her name, by
the way, is Emmeline, poor thing—was an avid
reader of ‘Cupid’s Labyrinth.’ And I’m afraid I
rather prevaricated.”</p>

<p>“Angela, you surprise me. What particular form
of lie did you blacken your soul with this time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t exactly <em>say</em> anything. But I
somehow allowed her to get the impression that it was I
who did the column. After all, Mr. Soames is a
friend of yours, so it wasn’t so very far from the
truth. Miles, she rose to the bait like anything.”</p>

<p>“Heaven forgive you! Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“It was all to save you twenty quid, after all. Up
till then, she’d been saying all the ordinary
things—she’d got a sister in London, whom she goes and
stays with; and she finds Chilthorpe rather slow,
hardly ever going to the pictures and that; and she’d
like to get up to London herself—it’s what they all
say. But when I let on that I was Aunt Daphne of
‘Cupid’s Labyrinth,’ she spread herself. How would
I advise a friend of hers to act who found herself
in a very delicate situation? So I told her to cough
it up. The friend, it seemed, had been walking out
with a young man who was quite decently off; that
is, he had quite enough to marry on. But one day he
explained to her that he had expectations of
becoming really very rich; if only a relation of his would
die, he would then come into a property far above
his own station, let alone hers.”</p>

<p>“The situation sounds arresting in more ways than
one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt. Well, the man suggested they
should get engaged, and they did, only on the quiet.
And then, a few weeks ago, or it might have been
a fortnight ago, this man suddenly informed her
friend that all his dreams of wealth had suddenly
collapsed. The rich relation had made a new will
in which he made no provision for his family.
And he, the young man, was very nice about it;
and said of course he’d asked her to marry him
at a time when he thought he could make her a rich
woman; and now he couldn’t. So if she wanted to
back out of the engagement now, he would give her
complete liberty.”</p>

<p>“Sportsman.”</p>

<p>“Her friend indignantly said ‘No’; she wouldn’t
dream of backing out. She wanted to marry him for
himself, not for his money, and all that. So they are
continuing to regard the engagement as a fixture.
But her difficulty, I mean the friend’s difficulty,
is this: was it just a sort of melodramatic
instinct which made her say that the money meant
nothing to her? Was it just her pride which made
her think she was still in love with the man, now
that he was no longer an heir? Or was she really still
in love with him? That was the problem, and I had
to set to and answer it.”</p>

<p>“And what was your answer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s hardly important, is it? Of course, I
put on my best Aunt Daphne manner, and tried to
think of the sort of tripe Soames would have
written. It wasn’t difficult, really. I said that if the man
was quite comfortably off as it was, it was
probably far better for them both that they shouldn’t
become enormously rich; and I laid it on thick about
the deceitfulness of riches, though I wish I’d more
experience of it, don’t you? And I said if they were
already walking out before the man mentioned
anything about the legacy, that proved that her friend
was already in love with him, or half in love with
him, before the question of money cropped up at
all. And I told her I thought her friend would be
very happy with the man, probably all the happier
because he knew that she wasn’t mercenary in her
ambitions, and all that sort of thing—I felt rather
a beast doing it. She was very grateful, and it didn’t
seem to occur to her for a moment that she was
giving herself away, horse, foot and guns. She
can’t have known, obviously, that you and Leyland
were rubbering in the lane last night. And so there
it is.”</p>

<p>“And confoundedly important at that. Angela, you
are a trump! We’ve got Leyland down, both ears
touching. He himself said that his theory about
Simmonds would break down if it could be proved
that Simmonds did know about the codicil, did
know that he’d been cut out of the will. And it can
be proved; we can prove it! It’s too much of a
coincidence, isn’t it, that all this should have happened
a fortnight ago or thereabouts? Obviously, it was
hearing about the codicil which made Simmonds
offer to free ‘Raight-ho’ from her engagement, and
jolly sporting of him, I consider.”</p>

<p>“Candour compels me to admit that I’ve been
rather efficient. But, Miles dear, the thing doesn’t
make sense yet. We know now that Simmonds wasn’t
expecting anything from his uncle’s will, and
therefore had no motive for murdering him, unless it was
mere spite. Then, why has Simmonds got the wind
up so badly? You aren’t as frightening as all that.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it still looks as if Simmonds had got
something on his mind. And we know that Brinkman’s
got something on his mind. Perhaps Brinkman will
react on this morning’s conversation and let us
know a little more about it.”</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, Brinkman came out from the
door of the inn. He came straight up to Bredon as
if he had been looking for him, and said, “Oh, Mr.
Bredon, I was wondering if you would care to come
for a bit of a walk. I shall get no exercise this
afternoon, with the funeral to attend, and I thought
perhaps you’d like a turn round the gorge. It’s
considered rather a local feature, and you oughtn’t to
leave without seeing it.”</p>

<p>It was clumsily done. He seemed to ignore
Angela’s presence, and pointedly excluded her, with
his eyes, from the invitation. It seemed evident that
the man was determined on a <i>tête-à-tête</i>. Angela’s
glance betrayed a surprise which she did not feel,
and perhaps a pique which she did, but she rose to
the occasion. “Do take him out, Mr. Brinkman.
He’s getting dreadfully fat down here. Instead of
taking exercise, he comes out and chats to me in
public, more like a friend than a husband—and
he’s making me drop my stitches.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t <em>you</em> coming?” asked Bredon, with a
wholly unnecessary wink.</p>

<p>“Not if I know it. I’m not dressed for gorge
inspecting. You may buy me a picture post-card of it,
if you like, on the way back.”</p>

<p>The two strolled off up the valley. Bredon’s heart
beat fast. It was evident that Brinkman was taking
advantage of the overheard conversation, and was
preparing to make some kind of disclosure. Was he
at last on the track of the secret? Well, he must
be careful not to betray himself by any leading
questions. The post of the amiable incompetent,
which he had already sustained with Brinkman,
would do well enough.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine thing, the gorge,” said Brinkman. “It
lies just below the Long Pool; but fortunately
Pulteney isn’t fishing the Long Pool to-day, so we
shan’t be shouted at and told to keep away from
the bank. I really think, apart from the fishing,
Chilthorpe is worth seeing, just for the gorge. Do
you know anything about geology and such things?”</p>

<p>“You can search me. Beats me how they do it.”</p>

<p>“It beats me how the stream does it. Here’s a
little trickle of water that can’t shift a pebble
weighing half a pound. Give it a few thousand years,
and it eats its way through the solid rock, and digs
a course for itself a matter of fifteen or twenty feet
deep. And all that process is a mere moment of time,
compared with the millions of years that lie behind
us. If you want to reckon the age of the earth’s
crust, they say, you must do it in thousands of
millions of years. Queer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Damned rum.”</p>

<p>“You almost understate the position. Don’t you
feel sometimes as if the whole of human life on this
planet were a mere episode, and all our boasted
human achievement were a speck on the ocean of
infinity?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. But one can always take a pill, can’t
one?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if it comes to that. . . . An amusing
creature, Pulteney.”</p>

<p>“Bit highbrow, isn’t he? He always makes me feel
rather as if I were back at school again. My wife
likes him, though.”</p>

<p>“He has the schoolmaster’s manner. It develops
the conversational style, talking to a lot of people
who have no chance of answering back. You get it
with parsons too, sometimes. I really believe it would
be almost a disappointment to him if he caught a
fish, so fond is he of satirizing his own performance. . . .
You haven’t been in these parts before, have
you?”</p>

<p>“Never. It’s a pity, really, to make their
acquaintance in such a tragic way. Gives you a kind of
depressing feeling about a place when your first
introduction to it is over a death-bed.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it must. . . . It’s a pity the country
out toward Pullford has been so much spoilt by
factories. It used to be some of the finest country in
England. And there’s nothing like English country,
is there? Have you travelled much, apart from the
war, of course?”</p>

<p>“Now, what the devil does this man think he’s
doing?” Bredon asked himself. Could it be that
Brinkman, after making up his mind to unbosom
himself, was feeling embarrassed about making a
start, was taking refuge in every other conceivable
topic so as to put off the dreaded moment of
confession? That seemed the only possible construction
to put on his conversational vagaries. But how to
give him a lead? “Very little, as a matter of fact.
I suppose you went about a good deal with
Mottram? I should think a fellow as rich as he was
gets a grand chance of seeing the world. Funny his
wanting to spend his holiday in a poky little place
like this.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose each of us has his favourite
corner of earth. There, do you see how deep the
river has cut its way into the rock?”</p>

<p>They had left the road by a foot-path, which led
down steeply through a wood of fir-trees and
waist-deep bracken to the river bank. They were now
looking up a deep gully, it almost seemed a funnel, of
rock; both sides falling sheer from the tumbled
boulders and fern-tufts of the hillside. Before them was a
narrow path which had been worn or cut out of the
rock-face, some five or six feet above the brawling
stream, just clear of the foam that sprang from its
sudden waterfalls. There was no habitation in view;
the roaring of the water drowned the voice unless
you shouted; the sun, so nearly at its zenith, could
not reach the foot of the rocks, and the gorge
itself looked gloomy and a little eerie from the
contrast. “Let’s go along the path a bit,” said Brinkman;
“one gets the effect of it better when one’s right in
the middle of it. The path,” he explained, “goes all
the way along, and it’s the regular way by which
people go up when they mean to fish the Long Pool.
I’ll go first, shall I?”</p>

<p>For a second Bredon hesitated. The man had so
obviously been making conversation all the way,
had so obviously been anxious to bring him to this
particular spot, that he suddenly conceived the idea
of hostile design. A slight push, disguised as an
effort to steady you round a corner, might easily
throw you off the path into the stream; they were
alone, and neither rock nor stream, in such an event,
would readily give up its secret. Then he felt the
impossibility of manufacturing any excuse for
refusing the invitation, Brinkman, too, was a good
foot smaller than himself. “All right,” he said, “I’ll
follow on.” He added a mental determination to
follow at a safe distance.</p>

<p>About twenty yards from the entrance, they
stopped at a resting-place where the rock-path
widened out till it was some five feet in breadth.
Behind it was a smooth face of rock six or seven feet
in height, a fresh narrow ledge separating it from
the next step in that giant’s stairway. “Curious, isn’t
it,” said Brinkman, “the way these rocks are piled
against one another? Look at that ledge that runs
along, over there to the right, almost like the rack
in a railway carriage! What accident made that,
or was it some forgotten human design?” It looked,
indeed, as if it might have been meant for the
larder-shelf of some outlaw who had hidden there in days
gone by. A piece of white paper—some sandwich
paper doubtless, that had fallen from above—tried
to complete the illusion. “Yes,” said Bredon, “you
expect to see a notice saying it’s for light articles
only. By Jove, this is a place!” Forgetting his
tremors, he passed by Brinkman, and went
exploring further along the gorge. Brinkman followed
slowly, almost reluctantly. There was no more
conversation till they reached the end of the gorge and
climbed up an easy path on to the highroad.</p>

<p>Now, surely, if there were going to be any
confidential disclosures, they would come. To Bredon’s
surprise his companion now seemed to have grown
moody and uncommunicative; whatever openings
were tried he not only failed to follow them up but
seemed, by his monosyllabic answers, to be
discouraging all approach. Bredon abandoned the effort at
last, and returned to the <i>Load of Mischief</i>
thoroughly dissatisfied with himself, and more
completely mystified than ever.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br/> A Scrap of Paper</h2>

<p>Leyland met him immediately on his
return. He had heard from Angela that Bredon
had gone out for a walk with Brinkman, and
at Brinkman’s invitation; something too of the
abruptness and the eagerness with which the
invitation was issued. Clearly, he was anxious to get
first news about Brinkman’s disclosures. There was
still half an hour or so to waste before luncheon;
and Bredon, taking a leaf out of his wife’s book,
suggested the ale-house bench as a suitable place for
talking things over.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Leyland. “I never dared to hope
that Brinkman would react so quickly. What did
he say? Or rather, what can you tell me of what he
said?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He just took me for
a walk to the gorge and back.”</p>

<p>“I say, old thing, are you playing quite fair? I
mean, if Brinkman only consented to talk to you
in confidence, by all means say so, and I’ll have to
be content.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t. He didn’t say a word he mightn’t
have said in the parlour to all of us. I can’t make
head or tail of it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, it’s absurd trying to palm that off
on me. I know you’re more scrupulous than I am
about these things; but really, what harm can it do
to tell me that Brinkman has confided to you? It
doesn’t make it any easier or any harder for me to
put you into the witness-box; and short of that I
can’t get it out of you if you don’t want to tell me.
I won’t badger you; I won’t try and worm it out of
you; honestly I won’t. But don’t pretend that you’re
still as ignorant of Brinkman’s movements this last
week as I am.”</p>

<p>“What the devil am I to say? Can’t you believe
a fellow when he tells the truth? I tell you that all
the way to the gorge he talked about anything that
came into his head; and coming back from the gorge
he wouldn’t talk about anything at all—I simply
couldn’t get him to talk.”</p>

<p>“And <em>at</em> the gorge?”</p>

<p>“He talked about the gorge. A regular morning
with Herr Baedeker. There really isn’t anything
more to it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, let’s get this straight. We put up a
conversation together in a place where we know for
a fact that Brinkman’s listening behind the wall—and
it isn’t the first time he’s listened to us, either.
I explain in a loud voice that I’ve taken out a
warrant, or rather that I’m just going to take out a
warrant, for his arrest, and that his best chance
of saving himself from arrest is to confide in you
or me. An hour or so afterward he comes up to you,
while you’re sitting out there with Mrs. Bredon
in the middle of a conversation. He takes no
notice at all of Mrs. Bredon, but asks you to come
out for a morning walk—on the transparent excuse
that he wants to shew you this beastly ditch of
his. And then he proceeds to waste more than an hour
of his time and yours by talking platitudes about
the scenery. Are we really going to sit down and
admit that?”</p>

<p>“Confound it all; we’ve got to. I’m no better
pleased about it than you are. But, God knows,
I gave him every chance of having a talk if he
wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he was trying to pump you,
perhaps? Can’t you remember at all what he did talk
about?”</p>

<p>“Talked about Pulteney a little. Said he was a
typical schoolmaster, or something of that sort.
Oh, yes, and he talked about geology—probable
age of the earth, if I remember right. Asked me
whether I’d been here before. Asked me whether I’d
been abroad much. I really can’t recall his saying
anything else.”</p>

<p>“And you’re sure you said nothing which could
frighten him, which could put him off?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have been more careful to avoid it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s—can you make anything of it
yourself?”</p>

<p>“The only idea that occurred to me is that
possibly Brinkman wanted me to be away from the
house for some reason; and chose this way of
making sure that I was.”</p>

<p>“M’m!—it’s possible, of course? But why should
he want you to be away—especially if he’s going
to be away too?”</p>

<p>“I know, it doesn’t really make sense. I say,
Leyland, I’m awfully sorry about this.” He felt absurdly
apologetic, though without seeing any way of putting
the blame on himself. “Look here, I’ll tell you one
thing: it’s not in our bargain, of course, but I don’t
think there’s any harm in telling you. Simmonds
didn’t know about the Euthanasia policy. Or rather,
he did expect it to come to him at one time, but not
this last week or two, because he’d heard about the
codicil leaving it to the Bishop—heard, at any rate,
that it wasn’t coming to him. So I’m afraid your
theory about Simmonds wants revising.”</p>

<p>“It has already been revised. This is very
interesting: you say it’s certain Simmonds knew about
the change of plan?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You can guess the source.”</p>

<p>“And do you suppose he had any idea where the
new will was kept? Whether it was up in London,
I mean, or in Mottram’s own possession?”</p>

<p>“That I couldn’t say. Does it make much
difference?”</p>

<p>“A lot of difference. Look here, you’ve been
dealing openly with me, so I’ll give you some
information in return. But I warn you you won’t like it,
because it doesn’t help your theory of a suicide a
bit. Look here.” He glanced round to see that
nobody was watching them, then took an envelope
from his pocket, and cautiously shook out into his
open palm a triangle of paper. It was blue, lined
paper, with an official sort of look about it. It was
obviously a corner left over from a document which
had been burned, for the hypotenuse opposite the
right angle was a frayed edge of brown ash. The
writing on it was “clerkly”—there is no other word
to describe its combination of ugliness with legibility.
Only a fragment of writing was left on each of the
three lines which the paper contained, for there
was a generous allowance of margin. It was a bottom
right-hand corner that the fire had spared; and the
surviving ends of the lines read:</p>

<p class="fragment">
“queath <br/>
aken out by <br/>
March in the year”
</p>

<p>“Well, how’s that?” said Leyland. “I don’t think
we shall differ much over the reading of it.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s really rather disappointing, when you
are supposed to be a detective, for a document to
come to hand in such excellent condition—what
there is of it. There aren’t two words in the
English language that end with the syllable ‘queath,’
and unless I am mistaken—no, as you were—the
word in the next line might be either ‘taken’ or
‘mistaken.’ And of course there’s Interlaken, when one
comes to think of it, and weaken, and shaken, and
oaken, and all sorts of words. But, as you say, or
rather imply, ‘taken out by’ makes the best sense.
And I shall hardly be communicating new
impressions to you if I suggest that one speaks of ‘taking
out’ insurance policies. Do you happen to know when
Mottram took out his Euthanasia? I believe I’ve
got the record upstairs.”</p>

<p>“He took it out in March. There isn’t a bit of
doubt about this document as it stands. It’s the
copy of a will, made out by Mottram, having
reference to the Euthanasia policy. Now, unless this was
a new will altogether—which is possible—that
means that this was a copy of his second will, or
rather of the codicil which referred to the policy.
For in the will, if you remember, there was no
allusion to the Euthanasia at all.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that it is absolutely certain that this
scrap of paper belonged to Mottram?”</p>

<p>“Quite certain—that’s the extraordinary thing, the
way I found it. The undertaker came round this
morning to make—well, certain arrangements. As
you know, I had taken command of the key of
Mottram’s room; it’s been locked by my orders ever
since you and I had that look round—except
yesterday, when I took the Coroner in. The undertaker
came to me for the key this morning, and I went into
the room with him; and, just mooning about there
aimlessly, I saw something that you and I had failed
to see when we were searching the room—this bit
of paper. We were not much to blame, for it was
rather hidden away, behind the writing-table; that
is, between the writing-table and the window. To
do us justice, I don’t know how we came to overlook
it. Considering it was in Mottram’s room, I don’t
think it is a very wild speculation to suppose that it
was a part of Mottram’s will.”</p>

<p>“No, that seems reasonable. And how does it fit
into your view of the case? I mean”——</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, it’s conceivable that Mottram
burned the thing himself. But it doesn’t really make
very much sense when you come to think of it. We
know, and Mottram knew, that it was only a spare
copy of the will which the solicitors had got up in
London. It wasn’t a very important document,
therefore, one way or the other. And I’m sure it hasn’t
escaped your observation that whereas burning
papers is a natural way to get rid of them in winter,
when there’s a fire in the grate, one doesn’t do it
in summer unless one’s absolutely put to it.
Nothing burns more ill-temperedly than a piece of paper
when you have to set light to it with a match. You
can’t even burn it whole, without great difficulty,
for you must either keep hold of it, and so leave
a corner unburnt, or else leave it lying about in a
grate or somewhere, and then the flame generally
dies down before it is finished. In this case, it is
pretty clear that somebody must have held it in
his hand, or it probably wouldn’t be a corner that
remained unburnt. I can find no finger-marks.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t a man who was destroying an
important document be apt to take care he didn’t leave
any of it lying about?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if he’d plenty of time to do it in.
If it had been Mottram, for example, burning his
own will. It seems to me more like the action of a
man in a hurry; and I suspect that the man who
burned this document was in a hurry. Or at least
he was flustered; for he had been committing a
murder, and so few people can keep their heads
altogether in that position.”</p>

<p>“It’s Simmonds, then, by your way of it?”</p>

<p>“Who else? You see, at first I was in rather a
difficulty. We had assumed, what it was natural to
assume, that this codicil which Mottram added to
his will was kept a secret—that Simmonds didn’t
know about it, and that he’d murdered Mottram
under the mistaken idea that he would inherit the
Euthanasia benefits as the next of kin. Now, if
that had been his intention, it would have been
rather a coincidence his <em>happening</em> to light on the
will and be able to burn it. But you tell me that
Simmonds did know about the codicil; very well,
that solves the difficulty. It was a double crime
not only in fact but in intention. You thought that
Simmonds’s knowledge of the codicil gave him a
sort of moral alibi. On the contrary, it only fastens
the halter round his neck. He determined to destroy
Mottram and the will together, and so inherit. The
motive is more obvious than ever. The only thing
which he unfortunately hadn’t taken into account
was the fact that the copy of the codicil which he
destroyed was a duplicate, and the original was up
in London.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t it rather a big supposition, that
Simmonds not only knew the codicil was in existence
but knew that it was in Mottram’s possession when
he came down here, and that it would be lying about
in Mottram’s room, quite easy for him to find?”</p>

<p>“You forget Mottram’s psychology. When
Simmonds offended him, he wasn’t content that
Simmonds should be cut out of his will; he wanted
him to know that he’d been cut out of the will—directed
the lawyers to inform him of the fact. When
he added that codicil about the Euthanasia,
although he made such a secret of it all round, he
was careful, as we know, to inform Simmonds that
it had been done. Don’t you think it’s likely that
he wrote to Simmonds and said, ‘I have willed the
Euthanasia policy away to strangers, so as to
prevent it coming to you; you can look in on me
when I’m at Chilthorpe, and I’ll shew you the
document’? And Simmonds, not understanding the
pernicketiness of lawyers, imagined that it would be
the original of the will, not a copy, that Mottram
had by him. So, when he came round here on his
midnight visit, or rather on his early morning visit,
he turned off the gas, flung the window open,
ransacked the despatch-box which he found lying on
the table, found the will, and burnt it hastily at the
open window. Probably he thought the unburnt
fragment had fallen out of the window; actually it had
fallen under the table, and here we are!”</p>

<p>“It was Angela, I suppose, who told you that
Simmonds knew he had been cut out of the will?”</p>

<p>“With the best intentions. Mrs. Bredon thought,
of course, that my suspicion of Simmonds could
not survive the revelation. As a matter of fact, it
all fitted in nicely. Well, it just shews that one
should never waste time trying to puzzle out a
problem until one’s sure that all the relevant facts
have been collated. Here were you and I worrying
our lives out over the difficulty, and all because we
had never noticed that bit of paper lying on the
floor—and might never have noticed it, if I hadn’t
happened to go in with the undertaker. Now, there’s
only Brinkman’s part of the business to settle. Apart
from that, it’s as clear as daylight.”</p>

<p>“You think so? Well, you must think me a
frightful Sadducee, but even now I don’t mind doubling
that bet again.”</p>

<p>“Forty pounds! Good Lord, man, the
Indescribable must pay you well! Or do they insure you
against losing bets? Well, it would eat a big hole
in my salary. But if you want to throw your money
away, I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Good! Forty quid. We’d best keep it dark from
Angela, though. I say, when ‘Raight-ho’ makes that
horrible noise on the tom-tom inside, it generally
means that Mrs. Davis has finished blowing the
dust off the cold ham. What’s wrong with going in
and seeing about a little lunch?”</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br/> A Visitor from Pullford</h2>

<p>When they came into the coffee room,
Bredon had the instantaneous impression
we all get occasionally that the room was
too full. Then, on disentangling his sensations, he
was delighted to find that the newcomer was Mr.
Eames, who was exchanging a word or two with
Brinkman, though he seemed not to have been
introduced to the others. “Good man!” said Bredon.
“I don’t think you met my wife, did you? This is
Mr. Pulteney . . . it was very good of you to keep
your promise.”</p>

<p>“As it turned out, I should have had to come in
any case. The Bishop had to go off to a confirmation,
so, when he heard the funeral was down here, he
sent me to represent him. You see, we heard from
the solicitors about our windfall—I suspect you
were keeping that dark, Mr. Bredon—and he was
very much touched by Mr. Mottram’s kindness.
He wished he could have come, Mr. Brinkman, but
of course a confirmation is a difficult engagement to
get out of.”</p>

<p>“I really knew nothing about the will when I came
over to Pullford,” protested Bredon. “I’ve heard
about it since, of course. Can I offer my
congratulations to the diocese, or would it look too much like
gifts from the Greeks?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; you serve your company, Mr.
Bredon, and none of us bears you any ill-will for it.
I hope, by the way, I have not been indiscreet in
mentioning the subject?” he glanced for a moment
at the old gentleman. “The Bishop, of course, has
not mentioned the matter except to me, because he
quite realizes there may be legal difficulties.”</p>

<p>“I can keep a secret as well as most men,”
explained Pulteney. “That is to say, I have the
common human vanity which makes every man like
to be in possession of a secret; and perhaps less
than my share of the vulgar itch for imparting
information. But you know Chilthorpe little, sir, if
you speak of discretion in the same four walls with
Mrs. Davis. I assure you that the testamentary
dispositions of the late Mr. Mottram are seldom off
her lips.”</p>

<p>There was a fractional pause, while everybody tried
to think how Mrs. Davis knew. Then they
remembered that the matter had been mentioned, though
only incidentally, at the inquest.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Eames. “I have met Mrs.
Davis before. If it is true that confession lightens
our burdens, the <i>Load of Mischief</i> must sit easily
on her.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad they haven’t changed the name of
the inn,” observed Angela. “These old-fashioned
names are getting so rare. And the <i>Load of Mischief</i>
is hardly an encouraging title.”</p>

<p>“There used,” said Eames, “to be an inn in my
old—in the parish where I lived—which was called
‘<i>The Labour in Vain</i>.’ I sometimes thought of it as
an omen.”</p>

<p>“Are you of the funeral party, Mr. Pulteney?”
asked Leyland, seeing the old gentleman dressed in
deep black.</p>

<p>“There is no hiding anything from you
detectives. Yes, I have promised myself the rustic treat
of a funeral. In the scholastic profession such thrills
are rare; they make us retire at sixty nowadays.
My lot is cast amidst the young; I see ever fresh
generations succeeding to the old, filling up the gaps
in the ranks of humanity; and I confess that when
one sees the specimens one sometimes doubts whether
the process is worth while. But do not let me cast
a gloom over our convivialities. Let us eat and drink,
Mrs. Davis’s ‘shape’ seems to say to us, for
to-morrow we die.”</p>

<p>“I hope I oughtn’t to have gone,” said Angela.
“I’d have brought my blacks if I’d thought of it.”</p>

<p>“Without them, you would be a glaring offence
against village etiquette. No, Mrs. Bredon, your
presence would not be expected. The company needs
no representatives at the funeral; more practical,
it sheds golden tears over the coffin. For the rest of
us it is different. Mr. Eames pays a last tribute to
his diocesan benefactor. Mr. Brinkman, like a good
secretary, must despatch the material envelope to
its permanent address. For myself, what am I? A
fellow wayfarer in an inn; and yet what more is
any of us in this brief world? No, Mrs. Bredon,
you are exempt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do stop him,” said Angela. “How did you
come down, Mr. Eames?”</p>

<p>“By the midday train, a funeral pageant in
itself. Was Mr. Mottram much known in the
neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>“He is now,” replied Mr. Pulteney, with
irrepressible ghoulishness. “The victim of sudden death
is like a diver; no instinct of decency withholds us
from watching his taking-off.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he had any near relations living,”
said Brinkman, “except young Simmonds. He’ll be
there, I suppose; but there wasn’t much love lost
between them. He will hardly be interested, anyhow,
in the reading of the will.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Mr. Brinkman, His Lordship asked
me to say that you will be very welcome at the
Cathedral house, if you are detained in Pullford at
all.”</p>

<p>“It is extremely kind of him. But I had wound up
all Mr. Mottram’s outstanding affairs before he
came away for his holiday, and I don’t suppose I
shall be needed. I was thinking of going up to
London in a day or two. I have to shift for myself,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Have some coffee, Eames,” suggested Bredon;
“you must need it after a tiring journey like that.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I think I will. Not that I’m tired, really.
It makes so much difference on the railway if you
are occupied.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you are one of those
fortunate creatures who can <em>work</em> in railway trains?”</p>

<p>“No, not work. I played patience all the way.”</p>

<p>“Patience? Did I hear you say patience? Ah, but
you only brought one pack, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, I always travel with two.”</p>

<p>“Two? And Mr. Pulteney has two! Angela, that
settles it! This afternoon I shall have a game.”</p>

<p>“Miles, dear, not <em>the</em> game? You know you can’t
play that and think of anything else at the same
time. Mr. Eames, would you mind dropping your
packs in the river? You see, it’s so bad for my
husband; he sits down to an interminable game of
patience, and forgets all about his work and
everything.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, Angela; it clears the
brain. When you’ve been puzzled over a thing, as I
have been over this question of suicide, your brains
get all stale and used up, and you must give them
a fresh start. A game of patience will just do the
trick. No, no milk, thanks. Would you tell Mrs.
Davis”—this was to the barmaid—“that I shall be
very busy all the latter part of this afternoon, and
mustn’t be disturbed on any account? It’s all right,
Angela; I’ll give you half an hour now to
remonstrate with me, but it won’t be any use.”</p>

<p>It was not, as a matter of fact, till after the
funeral party had left, and the coffin been removed,
that Miles and Angela foregathered. They went to
the old mill-house, feeling that it would be a safe
place for confidences now that Brinkman was
otherwise engaged. “Well,” said Angela, “I suppose you’re
wanting some Watson work?”</p>

<p>“Badly. Look here, one of us, either Leyland or I,
is beginning to feel the strain a bit. Everything that
crops up makes him more and more determined to
have Simmonds’s blood, and me more and more
inclined to stick to my old solution.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been doubling that bet again, have
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s a detail. Look here, I must tell you all
about his find this morning.” And he proceeded to
explain the whole business of the piece of paper, and
Leyland’s inferences from it. “Now,” he finished up,
“what d’you make of all that?”</p>

<p>“Well, he has got a case, hasn’t he? I mean, his
explanation would explain things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but look at the difficulties.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have them. No, wait a minute, I believe I
can do the difficulties. Let’s try a little womanly
intuish. First, you’d have noticed the piece of paper
if it had been there when you went in.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. It’s wonderful what one can
overlook if one isn’t thinking about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Simmonds wouldn’t have been such
a chump as to burn the thing on the spot. Especially
with a foul smell of gas in the room, not to mention
the corpse. He’d have shoved it into his pocket and
taken it home.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal in that. But Leyland would
say that Simmonds was afraid to do that for fear he
should be stopped and searched.”</p>

<p>“Pretty thin. And, then, of course, if it was really
important for him to get the document out of the
way, he wouldn’t have left a bit lying about. He’d
have seen that it was <em>all</em> burnt.”</p>

<p>“Leyland says that was because he was in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have some others. I’m used up.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you see that a man who is burning an
important document, holding it in his hand all the
time, takes it up by the least important corner,
probably a blank space at the top? This is the work of
a man who wasn’t particularly keen on destroying
all traces of the document, and he held it by the
bottom right-hand corner, as one naturally would.”</p>

<p>“Why not the left hand, and the match in one’s
right? Ha! The left-handed criminal. We <em>are</em> in
luck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it. You start holding it at the
left-hand corner, and then transfer it to your right
hand when you’ve thrown the match away. You try,
next time you’re burning your dressmaker’s bill. And
here’s another point: Simmonds would have been
bound to stand with his head right in the window, to
keep clear of the gas fumes. Almost certainly he
would have put the paper down on the window-sill
and let it burn, leaving one of those curious damp
marks. He didn’t, because I should have been bound
to notice that; I was looking for marks on the
window-sill. If he held it in his hand, he would be
holding it outside the window, and he wouldn’t be
such a chump as to throw away the odd corner in the
room when he could pitch it out of the window.
Another thing: he wouldn’t have dared to burn a light
at the window like that for fear of attracting
attention.”</p>

<p>“Well, I still think my objections were more
important. But go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, since that piece of paper wasn’t dropped
in the room before Leyland and I went into
it—probably not, anyhow—it looks as if it had been dropped
in the room since Leyland and I went into it. Or, at
any rate, since the first police search. Because the
room has been kept locked, one way and another,
since then.”</p>

<p>“There was no deceiving this man.”</p>

<p>“Which makes it very improbable that the piece of
paper was dropped there by accident at all. Anybody
who went in there had no business to go in there,
and would be jolly careful not to leave any traces.
We are therefore irresistibly compelled, my dear
Angela, to the conclusion that somebody dropped
it there on purpose.”</p>

<p>“That firm grasp of the obvious. Yes?”</p>

<p>“He put it there deliberately to create an
impression. Now, it might be to create the impression that
Simmonds was the murderer. To whose advantage
would that be?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Leyland’s.”</p>

<p>“Angela, don’t be flippant. Is there anybody?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Simmonds hasn’t any enemies that we
know of. Unless it was somebody who was
disappointed in the quality of his handkerchiefs. What
you <em>want</em> me to say is, that it must be somebody
who has murdered Mottram himself, and wants to
save his skin by pretending it was Simmonds that
did it.”</p>

<p>“I’m dashed if I want you to say that. In fact, it’s
just what I didn’t want you to say. Of course if you
assume that Mottram was murdered by Brinkman,
it does all work out, most unpleasantly well. You
see, when Leyland and I were sitting here, talking
at Brinkman, who was hiding behind the wall,
Leyland did say that the only thing which prevented him
from arresting Simmonds was the fact that he’d no
evidence to connect him with the actual room. I
could see what he was up to—he wanted Brinkman
to take the hint (assuming, of course, that he was
the real murderer) and start manufacturing clues
to incriminate Simmonds. Well, it looks very much
as if Brinkman had taken the hint, and were doing
identically what Leyland suggested. Curse it all.”</p>

<p>“Still, it was clever of Brinky to get in when the
door was locked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing. I wouldn’t put it beyond
Brinkman to have a duplicate key of that door. . . .
No, I’ve nothing to fall back on really except the
absence of motive. What earthly reason had
Brinkman for wanting to do Mottram in? Or rather, I
have one other thing to fall back on. But it’s not
evidence; it’s instinct.”</p>

<p>“As how?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see that the whole thing works
out too beastly well? Isn’t it rather too obviously a
ruse? I mean, that idea of dropping a piece of paper
with only half a dozen words on it, and yet those
half-dozen words shewing exactly what the
document was? Isn’t it rather too obviously a plant?”</p>

<p>“But it was a plant, if Brinky put it there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but isn’t it <em>too</em> obviously a plant? So
obviously, I mean, that you couldn’t expect anybody,
even Leyland, to think for a moment that it was
genuine? Can Brinkman really have thought that
Leyland wouldn’t see through it?”</p>

<p>“But if he didn’t think so”——</p>

<p>“Double bluff, my good woman, double bluff. I
can tell you, crime is becoming quite a specialized
profession nowadays. Don’t you see that Brinkman
argued to himself like this: ‘If I leave an obviously
faked clue lying about like this, Leyland will
immediately think that it is a faked clue, used by one
criminal to shove off the blame on another. Who the
criminals are, or which is which, doesn’t matter. It
will convince him that there has, after all, been a
murder. And it will disguise from him the fact that
it was suicide.’ Of course all that’s making
Brinkman out to be a pretty smart lad. But I fancy he is
a pretty smart lad. And I read that piece of paper
as a bit of double bluff, meant to harden the
ingenious Leyland in his belief that the suicide was a
murder.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. It’ll look pretty thin before a jury, won’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know that it’ll look thin before a jury?
Especially as, on my shewing, Brinkman was
prepared to let suspicion of murder rest on himself
rather than admit it was suicide. But it does give
us a motive. There’s no doubt that Brinkman is a
fanatical anti-clerical, and would do anything to
prevent Mottram’s money going to a Catholic
diocese. . . . I say, what’s that?”</p>

<p>A sudden sneeze, an unmistakable sneeze, had
come from somewhere immediately behind them. In
a twinkling Bredon had rushed round to the other
side of the wall. But there was nobody there.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br/> Mysterious Behaviour of the Old Gentleman</h2>

<p>Bredon and his wife looked at one another
in astonishment. It was impossible that the
funeral should yet be over; impossible,
surely, that Brinkman, whose place in the pageant
was such a prominent one, should have absented
himself from the ceremony unnoticed. There was no
doubt as to the path which the self-betrayed listener
must have taken. From behind the wall, there was a
gap in a privet-hedge, and through this there was a
direct and speedy retreat to the back door of the
inn. The inn itself, when they went back to it, was
as silent as the grave—indeed, the comparison
forced itself upon their minds. It was as if the coffin
from upstairs had taken all human life away with
it when it went on its last journey, leaving nothing
but the ticking of clocks and the steaming of a kettle
in the kitchen to rob solitude of its silence. Outside
the sun still shone brightly, though there was a
menacing bank of cloud coming up from the south.
The air felt breathless and oppressive; not a door
could bang, not a window rattle. The very flies on
the window-panes seemed drowsy. The Bredons
passed from room to room, in the vain hope of
discovering an intruder; everywhere the same
loneliness, the same stillness met them. Bredon had an
odd feeling as if they ought, after all, to be at the
funeral; it was so like the emptiness of his old
school when everybody was out of doors except
himself on a summer day.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand much of this,” he said. “Let’s go
down toward the churchyard, and see if we can
meet them coming back. Then at least we shall be
in a position to know who <em>wasn’t</em> here.”</p>

<p>The expedition, however, proved abortive; they
met Eames almost on the doorstep, and down the
street figures melting away by twos and threes from
the churchyard shewed that the funeral was at an
end. “I say, come in here,” said Bredon. “I want to
talk things over a bit, Mr. Eames.” And the three
retired into that “best room” where tea had been
laid on the afternoon of the Bredons’ arrival.
“You’ve just come back from the funeral?”</p>

<p>“This moment. Why?”</p>

<p>“Can you tell us for certain who was there? Was
Brinkman there, for example?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. He was standing just next me.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Simmonds from the shop—do you
know him by sight?”</p>

<p>“He was pointed out to me as the chief mourner.
I had a word with him afterward. But why all this
excitement about the local celebrities?”</p>

<p>“Tell him, Miles,” said Angela. “He may be able
to throw some light on all this.” And Bredon told
Eames of the strange eavesdropping that went on
behind the mill-house wall; something, too, of the
suspicions which he and Leyland entertained, and
the difficulty they both found in giving any
explanation of the whole tragedy.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s very extraordinary. Pulteney, of course
didn’t go after all”——</p>

<p>“Pulteney didn’t go?”</p>

<p>“No; didn’t you hear him say, soon after
luncheon, that his good resolutions had broken down, and
that he wasn’t going to the funeral after all? I
thought it rather extraordinary at the time.”</p>

<p>“You mean his sudden change of plan?”</p>

<p>“No, the reason he gave for it. He said the
afternoon was too tempting, and he really must go out
fishing.”</p>

<p>“Is that a very odd reason for Pulteney? He’s an
incalculable sort of creature.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it doesn’t happen to be true. Can’t you
feel the thunder in the air? If you can’t, the fishes
can, And when there’s thunder in the air they won’t
rise. Pulteney knows that as well as I do.”</p>

<p>“Would you know his rod if you saw it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was looking at it with him just before
luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Come on.” They went out into the front hall, and
Eames gave a quick glance round. “Yes, that’s it,
in the corner. He’s no more out fishing than you
or I.”</p>

<p>“Edward!” said Angela as they returned to the
best room. “To think it was my Edward all the
time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t rag, Angela; this is serious. Now, can’t
it have been Pulteney listening all along?”</p>

<p>“He was there, you know, when you and Leyland
arranged to go out to the mill-house after breakfast.
And he was there at luncheon, though I don’t think
either of us mentioned that we meant to go there.
Still, he might have guessed that. But what on earth
is the poor old dear up to?”</p>

<p>“Well, one or two things are clear. About
Brinkman, I mean. Whatever his idea may have been
when he took me out for a walk to the gorge and
talked about geology he wasn’t ‘reacting’ on
Leyland’s suggestion, because it wasn’t he who was
listening behind the wall when the suggestion was
made. And there’s another thing—this bit of paper
Leyland found lying about in the room upstairs. If
Brinkman put it there, then Brinkman did it on his
own; he wasn’t playing up to the suggestion which
Leyland made about wanting clues to incriminate
Simmonds with.”</p>

<p>“Still,” objected Angela, “we never proved that it
was Brinky who left that old clue lying about. We
only assumed it, because we thought it was Brinky
who was listening behind the wall.”</p>

<p>“You mean that if Pulteney was listening, and
Pulteney was—well, was somehow interested in
confusing the tracks of the murder, it may have been
he who left the bit of paper under the table.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so. But it seems quite as much on
the cards as anything else in this frightful business.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see, now, what do we know about Pulteney?
We know, in the first place, that he was sleeping in
the house on the night when Mottram died. Actually,
he had the room next door to Mottram’s—between
his and the one we’ve got now. According to his own
evidence, he slept soundly all night, and heard
nothing. On the other hand, his own evidence shewed
that he went to bed after Mottram and Brinkman,
and we’ve nothing, therefore, to confirm his own
account of his movements. He was woken up the next
morning after the tragedy had occurred, and when
he was told about it all he said was—what was it,
Angela?”</p>

<p>“ ‘In that case, Mrs. Davis, I shall fish the Long
Pool this morning.’ ”</p>

<p>“That might almost be represented as suggesting
that he wasn’t exactly surprised when he heard of
Mottram’s death, mightn’t it? All his references to
Mottram’s death since then have been rather—shall
we say?—lacking in feeling. He, no less than
Brinkman, seemed to be anxious that we should interpret
the death as suicide, because it was he who suggested
to me that idea about Mottram having brought down
the wrong flies, as if he never really had any
intention of fishing at all. He has been rather inquisitive
about when Brinkman was leaving, and when we
were leaving too, for that matter. That’s all you can
scrape together, I think, against his general
behaviour. And against that, of course, you’ve got to
put the absence of all known motive.”</p>

<p>“And the general character of the man,”
suggested Eames.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. . . . What impression exactly does
he make on you?”</p>

<p>“Why, that he is out of touch with real life. All
that <i>macabre</i> humour of his about corpses and so on
is an academic thing—he has never really felt death
close to. I don’t say that a superb actor mightn’t
adopt that ironical pose. I only say it’s far more
natural to regard him as a harmless old gentleman
who reflects and doesn’t act. It’s very seldom that
you find the capacity for acute reflection and the
capacity for successful action combined in the same
character. At least, that’s always been my
impression.”</p>

<p>“Well, granted that we acquit him of the main
charge, as Leyland would acquit Brinkman of the
main charge. He still comes under the minor
suspicion of eavesdropping. He’s as good a candidate
for that position as Brinkman himself, only that it
was Brinkman’s brand of cigarette we found behind
the wall yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Edward had run out, you remember,” suggested
Angela. “He might have borrowed one from Brinky,
or pinched it when he wasn’t looking. And to be
accurate, we must remember that the first time we
were overheard, when we were talking in my room,
the listener had disappeared before you got into the
passage, and the next room to ours is Edward’s.”</p>

<p>“And besides, we know now that it wasn’t
Brinkman, this time at any rate. Because he was away
at the funeral. Whereas Pulteney shirked the funeral
on an obviously false ground; didn’t go to the
funeral and didn’t go fishing either. Assuming that the
listener is the same all through, it looks bad for
Pulteney.”</p>

<p>A knock at the door suddenly interrupted their
interview. “May I come in?” said a gentle voice, and
following it, flushed as with hot walking yet still
beaming with its habitual benevolence, came the
face of Mr. Pulteney.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Bredon, they told me I would find you
in here. I wanted a word with you. Could we go
outside, or”——</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Mr. Pulteney,” said Angela firmly.
“What Mr. Eames and I don’t know isn’t worth
knowing. Come in and tell us all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I’m afraid I’ve got to make a
kind of confession. It’s a very humiliating
confession for me to make, because I’m afraid, once again,
I’ve been guilty of curiosity. I simply cannot mind
my own business.”</p>

<p>“And what have you been up to now?” asked
Angela.</p>

<p>“Why, when I said I was going out fishing this
afternoon, I’m afraid I was guilty of a prevarication.
Indeed, when I announced my intention of going to
the funeral, I was beginning to weave the tangled
web of those who first practise to deceive. You see,
I didn’t want Brinkman to know.”</p>

<p>“To know what?”</p>

<p>“Well, that I was rather suspicious about his
movements. You see, I’ve asked him several times
when he means to leave Chilthorpe, and he always
talks as if he was quite uncertain of his plans. He
did so at breakfast, you remember. But this
morning, when I went up to get a sponge I had left in
the bathroom, I saw Brinkman packing.”</p>

<p>“Packing?”</p>

<p>“Well, he was wandering about the room clearing
up his papers, and there was a despatch-box open
on the table, and a suitcase on the floor. And, as I
knew he was due to be at the funeral, I thought
this was rather a funny time for him to want to
leave. Especially as he’d given no notice to Mrs.
Davis. So I wondered whether, perhaps, there was
anything behind it.”</p>

<p>“You did well to wonder,” said Bredon. “So what
did you do?”</p>

<p>“Well it stuck in my head that Mottram, when he
came down here, came in a motor-car. Mrs. Davis,
though her trade announcement advertises good
accommodation for man and beast, does not run to a
garage. There is only one in Chilthorpe; you can
just see it down the road there. Now, thought I, if
by any chance Mr. Brinkman is meditating a
precipitate disappearance, it would be like his caution
to have made all arrangements beforehand. And if
I went down to the garage and had a look at the
car, it might be that I, though heaven knows I am
no motorist, should be able to see whether he had
got the car in proper trim for a journey.”</p>

<p>“You must have talked very nicely to the garage
people,” suggested Angela. “It would never do if
you were suspected of being a motor-thief.”</p>

<p>“Well, I had to do my best. I changed my mind
about going to the funeral, and made the excuse
that I wanted to go fishing. I heard you gasp, Mr.
Eames; but Brinkman knows nothing about
fishing. Then, when you had started, I went off to the
garage by myself. Fortunately, very fortunately for
my purpose, it proved that there was nobody in.
There are only two men, in any case, and they
neglect their business a good deal. I had an excuse
if one was needed, but when I found myself alone
in the garage I flung caution to the winds. There was
a cardcase inside which shewed me which was
Mottram’s car. My investigations led me to the
conclusion that the car was in readiness for an immediate
and secret departure for some considerable journey.”</p>

<p>“Do tell us what they were,” said Angela
demurely. “Just for the interest of the thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I removed with some difficulty a kind of
cap from that thing behind, which put me in a
position to examine the interior of what is, I suspect,
called the petrol-tank. The careful insertion of a
pencil shewed that the tank was quite full; which
suggested that a refill had been obtained since they
arrived.”</p>

<p>“They might have run short on the journey down,
a mile or two out,” suggested Angela. “But this was
not all?”</p>

<p>“No, there was a map lying on the driver’s seat,
somewhat carelessly folded up. I thought it a point
of interest that this map did not include Pullford,
and seemed to contemplate an expedition to the west
or southwest.”</p>

<p>“There’s not a great deal in that,” said Bredon.
“Still, it’s suggestive. Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I lifted up one of the seats, and
found there a collection of sandwiches and a large
flask of whisky.”</p>

<p>“The devil you did! But they might have been
for the journey down here. Did you taste the
sandwiches to see if they were fresh?”</p>

<p>“I took that liberty. They seemed to me, I must
say, a trifle on the stale side. But who was I to
complain? I was, as it were, a guest. Meanwhile, let me
point out to you the improbability of Mottram’s
loading up his car with sandwiches for a
twenty-mile drive.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. Were they properly cut?
Professional work, I mean?”</p>

<p>“I suspected the hand of the artist. Mrs. Davis,
no doubt. The whisky I did not feel at liberty to
broach. But the idea suggested itself to me that
these were the preparations of a man who is
contemplating a considerable journey, and probably one
which will not allow him time to take his meals at
a public-house.”</p>

<p>“And why a secret departure?”</p>

<p>“Why, somebody had induced a coat of black
paint over what I take to be the number-plate of
the car. I am a mere novice in such matters, but is
that usual?”</p>

<p>“It is not frequently done. And was the paint still
wet?”</p>

<p>“That is a curious point. The paint was dry. I
supposed then, that Brinkman’s preparations for
departure were not made yesterday or the day
before.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully kind of you to take all this trouble,
and to come and tell us.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I thought perhaps it might be worth
mentioning, in case you thought it best, well, to
lay hands somehow on Brinkman.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Pulteney,” said Angela, bubbling over,
“we were just preparing to lay hands on you!”</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br/> The Barmaid Is Brought to Book</h2>

<p>The bewilderment registered by Mr.
Pulteney’s face at this extraordinary
announcement rapidly gave way to a look of intense
gratification. “At last,” he said, “I have lived! To
be mistaken for a criminal, perhaps a murderer—it
is my <i>nunc dimittis</i>. All these years I have lived
the blameless life of one who is continually called
upon to edify his juniors; I have risen early in order
to convict my pupils of the sin of being late; I
have eaten sparingly in order to pretend that the
food provided by our establishment is satisfying
when it is not; I have pretended to sentiments of
patriotism, of rugged sportsmanship, of moral
approval or indignation, which I did not feel. There
is little to choose, believe me, between the fakir
and the schoolmaster; either must spend days of
wearisome mortification, because that is the way
in which he gets his living. And now, for one
crowded hour of glorious old age, I have been
mistaken for a guilty intriguer. The blood flows richer
in my veins; I am overcome with gratitude. If only
I could have kept it up!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Eames,” said Angela, “there’s one thing you
said which you’ve got to take back. You said Mr.
Pulteney was too much a man of reflection to be a
man of action as well. And now you’ve heard how
he broke into a garage, stole a piece of sandwich,
and took the cap off a petrol-tank without being
in the least certain that the car wouldn’t explode.
Is this the pale scholar you pictured to us?”</p>

<p>“I apologize,” said Eames. “I apologize to Mr.
Pulteney unreservedly. I will form no more
judgments of character. You may tell me that Mrs.
Davis is a murderess, if you will, and I will discuss
the proposition on its merits.”</p>

<p>“Talking of which,” said Angela, “the cream of
the situation is that we <em>still</em> don’t know who it was
that was rubbering behind that beastly mill-house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that,” said Eames diffidently, “I’ve felt
fairly certain about that all along. I suppose it’s the
result of living with priests that one becomes thus
worldly wise. But didn’t you know, Mr. Bredon, that
maids always steal their masters’ cigarettes? It is,
I believe, a more or less recognized form of
perquisite. Every liberty taken by the rich is aped by their
domestics. And, although she is not in household
service, I have no doubt that the barmaid here
claims a like privilege.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean”—— began Bredon:</p>

<p>“You noticed, surely, that her fingers are a little
stained with brown? I noticed it when she brought
in my fried eggs. Ladies generally have expensive
tastes in cigarettes, and I have no doubt that this
maid would go for the Callipoli if she got a chance.”</p>

<p>“Miles, dear,” said Angela softly, “who was it
said that it must be a servant who was listening at
our bedroom door?”</p>

<p>“The uneducated do not take Mr. Pulteney’s view
about curiosity. I daresay this young lady often
listens at keyholes. With a corpse in the house, and
detectives about, she listens with all the more
avidity. And if the detectives insist on exchanging
confidences close to that precise point in the
shrubbery at which she is in the habit of smoking
purloined cigarettes, they put themselves in her hands.
But a stronger motive supervenes; what she
overhears out of pure curiosity turns out to be of vital
importance to herself. She learns that the young
man she is walking out with is suspected of
murder.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, and of course it was she who reacted
on our suggestions, not Brinkman! I don’t know if
I mentioned it to you, Angela, but when Leyland
and I were talking together at the mill-house, he
said the only thing that would make him hesitate to
arrest Simmonds would be evidence shewing that
Simmonds knew he wasn’t Mottram’s heir. And it
was exactly that evidence which ‘Raight-ho’
proceeded to produce.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Angela, “How perfectly odious! You
mean that when I thought I was pumping Emmeline
so cleverly, and getting out of her exactly what I
wanted, she was really doing it all on purpose, and
telling me exactly what <em>she</em> wanted?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so, my dear. A lot of reputations
seem to be going west to-day. And, of course, I
should say it’s odds that her whole story was
absolutely trumped up, invented to suit the occasion.
And we’re back exactly where we were, not
knowing whether Simmonds knew he was cut out of the
will or not.”</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” said Angela, “we do know,
now, what put the wind up young Simmonds so
badly. When you and Leyland passed him and
Emmeline in the lane last night, she was telling him
that he was suspected of murder, and had better be
dashed careful what he said and who he said it to.
Naturally it gave him a bit of a fright when he
thought you were going to pump him about his
uncle.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile, what has Brinkman been up to?
We’ve really no evidence against him until all this
about the car cropped up. Dash it all, and just when
I was going to get a game of patience!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to put my oar in unduly,” said
the old gentleman in an apologetic tone, “but might
it not be a good thing to acquaint Mr. Leyland with
the somewhat unusual state of affairs down at the
garage? If Brinkman really intends to do what is
popularly known as a ‘bunk,’ he may be off at any
moment. Had I been more expert, I could no doubt
have immobilized some important part of the
mechanism. As it was, I was helpless.”</p>

<p>“Where is Leyland, by the way?” asked Bredon.</p>

<p>“He is just coming up the street now,” said
Eames, looking out of the window. “I’ll call to him
to come in here.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, what have you been up to?” asked
Bredon, as Leyland entered.</p>

<p>“Why, to tell the truth, I have been shadowing
Mr. Pulteney. I must apologize, Mr. Pulteney, but
I felt bound to be careful. I’ve had you kept under
close observation all this week; and it was only as I
stood behind the door, watching your investigations
into that car, that I became perfectly convinced of
your innocence.”</p>

<p>“What! more suspicion! This is indeed a day!
Why, if I had had the least conception that you were
watching me, Mr. Leyland, I would have led you a
rare dance! My movements, I promise you, should
have been full of mystery. I should have gone out
every night with a scowl and a dark lantern. I am
overwhelmed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must apologize at least for spying upon
your detective work. You do very well for an
amateur, Mr. Pulteney, but you are not suspicious
enough.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I overlooked something? How
mortifying!”</p>

<p>“Yes, when you took the cushion off that front
seat, you failed to observe that there was a neat tear
in it, which had been quite recently sewn up.
Otherwise I am sure that you would have done what I did
just now—cut it open.”</p>

<p>“And is it fair to ask what you found inside?”</p>

<p>“Well, we seem to have gone too far now to have
any secrets between us. I feel sure that both you,
Mr. Pulteney, and you, Mr. Eames, are anxious to
see justice done, and are prepared to help at least
by your silence.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Pulteney.</p>

<p>“I am at your service,” said Eames.</p>

<p>“Well, this is actually what I found.” With a
dramatic gesture he produced a small waterproof
wallet, and turned out its contents. “You will find
a thousand pounds there, all in Bank of England
notes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bredon, when the exclamations of
surprise had died away, “are you still suspecting
young Simmonds?”</p>

<p>“I’m not easy about him yet in my own mind.
But of course I see Brinkman’s deeper in this
business than I had suspected so far. A man who’s
innocent doesn’t prepare to do a bolt with a
thousand pounds and a motor-car that doesn’t belong to
him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bredon, “I suppose we ought to be
keeping an eye on Mr. Brinkman.”</p>

<p>“My dear old thing,” said Leyland, “don’t you
realize that I’ve had two of my men at the <i>Swan</i>
all this week, and that Brinkman hasn’t been
unaccounted for for one moment? The trouble is, he
knows he’s being watched, so he won’t give
himself away. At least I’m pretty sure of it. But the
motor, of course, puts us in a very good position.
We know how he means to escape, and we can
afford to take the watch off him and put it on the
motor instead. Then he’ll shew his hand, because
he’s mad keen to be off. At present he’s in his room,
smoking a cigarette and reading an old novel. He
won’t move, I think, until he makes certain that
we’re all out of the way. Probably not till after
supper, because a night ride will suit his purpose
best. And he’s got a night for it too; there’s a big
storm coming on, unless I’m mistaken.”</p>

<p>“And what about Simmonds?” asked Bredon.</p>

<p>“And the barmaid?” added Angela.</p>

<p>“Well, of course I could question both or either of
them. But I’d sooner not, if I can help it; it’s cruel
work, I was wondering if you, Mrs. Bredon, could
go and have a talk to that maid after we’ve had our
tea, and see what satisfaction you can get out of
her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind at all. In fact, I rather want to have
it out with dear Emmeline. I owe her one, you see.
Meanwhile, let’s have tea by all means. I wonder if
Brinky will come down to it?”</p>

<p>Brinkman did come down, and tea was not a very
enlivening meal. Everybody in the room looked upon
him as a man who was probably a murderer and
certainly a thief. Consequently everybody tried to be
nice to him, and everybody’s style was cramped by
the effort. Even Mr. Pulteney’s verbosity seemed
to have been dried up by the embarrassment of the
situation. On the whole, Eames carried it off best.
His dry, melancholy manner was quite unaltered;
he talked about patience to Bredon, he talked
Pullford gossip to Brinkman; he tried to draw out
Pulteney on educational questions. But most of the
party were glad when it was over, when Brinkman
had shut himself up again, and Angela had betaken
herself to the back premises to have it out with the
barmaid.</p>

<p>The “best room” had been turned by common
consent into a sort of committee room; during all
this whirligig of sensations, the background of their
mind was filled with those protuberant portraits of
the late Mr. Davis which so defiantly occupied the
walls. It was here that Angela found them assembled
when she came up, some half an hour later, a little
red about the eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t try any subterfuges this time; I
let her have it straight from the shoulder. And then
she cried, and I cried, and we both cried together
a good bit.”</p>

<p>“The mysterious sex again,” said Mr. Pulteney.</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t understand, of course. Anyhow,
she’s had a rotten time. That first evening, when she
listened outside the door, it was only for a moment
or two, out of sheer curiosity, and she didn’t hear
anything that interested her. It was yesterday
evening, when you two were talking, that she got
interested. She overheard at first merely by accident,
which just shews how careful you ought to be. She
caught the name ‘Simmonds’; she heard, for the first
time, about the Euthanasia policy, and what it might
have meant to him and to her. She went on
listening, naturally, and so she came in for all Mr.
Leyland’s exposition of the case against Simmonds. You
didn’t convince my husband, Mr. Leyland, but you
had a much greater success on the other side of the
wall. The poor girl, who’s been brought up on
novelettes and penny-shockers all her life, drank in the
whole story. She really believed that the man who
had been making love to her, the man she was in
love with, was a cold-blooded murderer. She acted
I think, very well. He came round that evening to
take her out for an evening walk, and on the way
she taxed him with his supposed crime. If you come
to think of it, that was sporting of her.”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Leyland. “People are found dead
in ditches for less than that.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, it worked all right. Simmonds
listened to her charges, and then denied them all.
He didn’t give her any evidence for his denial, but
she believed him. There was no quarrel. Next day,
that is to say this morning, Emmeline heard you two
arranging for a talk at the mill-house. She didn’t
suspect the trap; she walked straight into it. What
she heard made her believe that there was only one
way to save Simmonds—to pretend that he knew
about the Euthanasia, and knew the money wasn’t
coming to him. The poor girl reflected that
Simmonds had been hanging round the house on the
night of Mottram’s death; he had been there waiting
to see her when she left the bar at closing time. So,
bravely again, I think, she came to me with her
story about the anonymous friend and her young
man with his lost legacy. Of course, by sheer
accident, I made it much easier for her to pitch me
this yarn, and I swallowed it whole. She thought
that, with some blackening of her own conscience,
she had saved an innocent man’s life.”</p>

<p>“And that’s all she knows, so far?”</p>

<p>“No, at the end of lunch she heard you, Miles,
saying that you’d give me half an hour to talk
things over. So when she saw us stealing down to
the now familiar trysting-place by the mill—she
hadn’t gone to the funeral—she followed us and
listened again. And, to her horror, she realized from
what you said that all her lying had failed to do its
work. Leyland still believed, believed more than
ever, that her young man was the criminal. Her
anxiety put her off her guard, and a sudden sneeze
gave her away. She didn’t dare go back to the house;
she hid in the privet-hedge.”</p>

<p>“And the long and short of it is,” suggested
Leyland, “that her story is no evidence at all. Simmonds
may be as guilty or as innocent as you like; she
knew nothing about it. Can she give any account of
Simmonds’s movements on the night of the
murder?”</p>

<p>“Well, she says she had to be in the bar up to
closing time, and then she slipped round to the back
door, where he was waiting for her, and stood there
talking to him.”</p>

<p>“For how long?”</p>

<p>“She says it might have been a quarter of an hour,
or it might have been three quarters of an hour; she
really couldn’t say.”</p>

<p>“That sounds pretty thin.”</p>

<p>“How impossible you bachelors are! Miles, can’t
you explain to him? Oh, well, I suppose it’s no use;
you couldn’t possibly understand.”</p>

<p>“It’s certainly rather an unfortunate circumstance
for Simmonds that, just at the moment the gas was
turned on in Mottram’s room, he was indulging in a
kind of ecstasy which may have lasted a quarter of
an hour, or may have lasted three quarters.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” said Bredon, “I hope you realize
that your own case against Simmonds is considerably
weakened? You were trying to make out, if you
remember, that Simmonds murdered Mottram and
burned the will, knowing that the will cut him out
of his inheritance. But since we have learned to
discredit the testimony of ‘Raight-ho,’ we have no
evidence that Simmonds ever knew anything about the
will, or had ever so much as heard of the Euthanasia
policy.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. And it’s also true that these last
discoveries have made me more inclined to suspect
Brinkman. I shall have to keep my eye on
Simmonds, but for the time being Brinkman is the
quarry we must hunt. It’s Brinkman’s confession
I look forward to for the prospect of those forty
pounds.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you can catch Brinkman and make him
confess, you’re welcome to them. Or even if
Brinkman does himself in somehow, commits suicide rather
than face the question, I’ll give you the benefit of
the doubt, and we’ll treat it as murder. Meanwhile,
if you will excuse me, I think I’ve just time to lay
out that patience before supper.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s hopeless,” said Angela.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX. <br/> How Leyland Spent the Evening</h2>

<p>Bredon was not allowed to escape so easily.
Leyland insisted that their plans must be
settled at once, before supper time. “You see,”
he said, “we’ve got to make rings round Brinkman,
and he’s got to fancy that he is not under
observation. That’s going to be a difficult job. But it’s made
easy for us, rather, by the fact that Friday night
is cinema night in Chilthorpe.”</p>

<p>“A cinema at Chilthorpe!” protested Mr.
Pulteney. “Good God!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a sort of barn out behind the
rectory, and one of these travelling shows comes round
once a week or once a fortnight. It’s extraordinary
how civilization has developed, isn’t it? My idea was
this: our friend the barmaid is to come in at supper,
and ask us if we shall be wanting anything for the
night, and whether she can go out. The Boots, she
will say quite truthfully, is going to the cinema, and
she wants to do the same. Mrs. Davis will be kept
busy at the bar. Therefore there will be nobody to
attend to the bell if we ring—she will ask us whether
we mind that.”</p>

<p>“Machiavellian!” said Mr. Pulteney.</p>

<p>“Then somebody—you, Mrs. Bredon, for choice—will
suggest <em>our</em> making up a party for the cinema.
Your husband will refuse, because he wants to stay
at home playing patience.”</p>

<p>“Come, I like this scheme,” said Bredon. “It
seems to me to be all on the right lines. I only hope
that you will allow me to be as good as my word.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; I’m coming to that. The rest of
us will consent to accompany Mrs. Bredon;
Brinkman, presumably, will refuse. Soon after
supper—the performance is at eight—we will all leave the
house in the direction of the cinema, which is
fortunately the opposite direction from the garage.”</p>

<p>“And have I got to sit through an evening
performance in the barn?” asked Angela.</p>

<p>“Why, no; I want you and Mr. Eames to make
your way back to the inn, by turning off along the
lane which leads to the old mill; then you can come
in quietly by the privet-hedge at the back. Then I
want you, Mr. Eames, to wait about in the passage
which leads to the bar, dodging down the cellar
stairs if Brinkman comes to the bar to have a
fortifier on his way. I hope your reputation will not
suffer from these movements. You will keep your
eye on the front of the house, in case Brinkman goes
out that way.”</p>

<p>“He’s a fool if he does,” said Bredon. “In the first
place, it’s a shorter way to the garage to take the
path that goes out at the back. And in the second
place, if he takes that path he will be unnoticed,
whereas if he comes out by the front door he will
be under the eyes of the bar parlour.”</p>

<p>“I know, and I am going to discourage him still
further from going out at the front by leaving you
to keep a lookout. Your window faces the front,
doesn’t it? Very well, then, you will sit in your room
playing patience, but right in the window-seat,
please, and with the blind up.”</p>

<p>“But I say, if he goes out by the front way, have
I got to track him? Because”——</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t. Mr. Eames is to do that. You
sit still where you are and go on playing patience.
Mr. Eames, if Brinkman goes out by the front door,
you will see him; you will wait till he is round the
corner, and then follow him at a distance. That, of
course, is only to make sure what he does on the
way to the garage; you are not to overtake him or
interfere with him.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“And what am I to do?” asked Angela.</p>

<p>“Well, I was wondering if, on returning from our
false start, you would mind going up unnoticed to
your husband’s room? The back stairs are very
handy for the purpose. You could sit there reading,
or anything, and then if Brinkman does leave by the
front, your husband, while still sitting at the window
and pretending not to notice, could pass the word to
you. You would then go downstairs and ring up the
garage, so that we shall be ready for Brinkman when
he comes.”</p>

<p>“That will be a thoroughly typical scene. And are
you taking poor Mr. Pulteney to the post of honour
and of danger?”</p>

<p>“If Mr. Pulteney does not object. He knows his
way about the garage.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to go where glory waits. If I
fall, I hope that you will put up a plain but tasteful
monument over me, indicating that I died doing
somebody else’s duty.”</p>

<p>“And what about your two men?” asked Bredon.</p>

<p>“One of them will be told off to watch Simmonds.
As I told you, I can’t afford to leave Simmonds out
of account. The other will wait out at the back, in a
place I have selected; if (or rather when) Brinkman
comes out at the back door to make his way to the
garage, my man will follow him at a distance, and
will take his post at the garage door, in case there’s
any rough work there. That, I think, accounts for
the whole party.”</p>

<p>“How long does our vigil last?” asked Eames.</p>

<p>“Not, I imagine beyond nine o’clock. That is the
hour at which the garage shuts; and, although there
is a bell by which the proprietor can be fetched out
if necessary, I hardly think that Brinkman would
take the risk. The dusk is closing early this evening,
with all these clouds about; and if, as I strongly
suspect, there is a thunder-storm, it will be a capital
night for his purpose. It’s a nuisance for us, because
I haven’t dared to leave any of my watching-parties
out of doors for fear of a deluge.”</p>

<p>If tea had been an embarrassing meal, supper was
a positive nightmare. But when the barmaid,
carefully coached by Angela, asked for leave to go out
to the pictures, a perfect piece of acting began.
Angela’s suggestion to her husband was beautifully
done, so was his languid reply; Mr. Pulteney
excelled himself in the eagerness with which he offered
to be her cavalier; Leyland’s shew of reluctance over
the programme, and Eames’s humorous resignation
to his fate, completed the picture. Brinkman, after
one nerve-racking pause, said he thought on the
whole he would rather be excused. He found the
cinema tiring to the eyes. “Good,” said Bredon;
“then you and I will keep the home-fires burning.
It’s true I shall be sitting upstairs, because I’ve got
my patience all laid out up there, and I haven’t the
heart to desert it. But if you’re frightened of
thunder, Mr. Brinkman, you can always come up and
have a crack with me.”</p>

<p>The alleged cinema party left at five minutes to
eight. By that time Bredon was already immersed in
his mysteries upstairs; and it was Brinkman,
smilingly apologetic, who saw them off at the front door.
“Don’t sit up for us if we’re late, Mr. Brinkman,”
said Angela, with the woman’s instinct of overdoing
an acted part; “we’ll throw brickbats in at my
husband’s window.” The inn door, with its ridiculous
panes of blue and yellow, shut behind them, and
they heard the unsuspecting footsteps of their
victim climbing the stairs. As they passed down the
street, a few drops of rain were falling, uneasy
presages of the storm. Angela quickened her pace;
she had not carried realism to the extent of arming
herself with an umbrella. It was, in truth, but a short
distance she and Eames had to travel; they were
only just out of sight round a bend of the street
when they doubled back upon the lane by which they
were to return to the inn. At the entrance of it they
met Emmeline, with the Boots in attendance; it
was difficult not to believe that, upon arrival at the
cinema, he would be replaced by a more favoured
escort. Leyland and Pulteney just stood long enough
at the turning to make sure that all had gone well,
and then continued their journey to the garage.</p>

<p>Here all was clearly in readiness; the proprietor
was waiting for them at the door to receive his
orders.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Leyland, “this gentleman and
I are going to watch for a bit in here. Where’s the
telephone? Ah, that’s all right; very well, we’ll get
behind this lorry. If anybody comes into the garage
and wants you, he can ring that bell, can’t he? And
if anybody rings up on the telephone, we’ll take the
message; and if it’s for you, not for us, we’ll let you
know. Meanwhile, I suppose you and your mate can
keep in the background?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sir, there won’t be any difficulty
about that. About how long might you be requiring
the use of the garage for, sir?”</p>

<p>“Till nine o’clock—that’s your closing time, isn’t
it? Any objections?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no difficulty, sir, except that I’ve got
to take my car out: I’ve got to meet a gentleman
who’s coming down on the 8.40 train. But if I take
it straight out, and don’t waste any time over it,
that’ll be all right, won’t it? She’s all ready for
starting.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Twenty minutes to nine—or I suppose
you’ll want it about twenty-five to. Well, you may
see us when you come back, or you may not. There’s
nothing else, then.”</p>

<p>As the proprietor withdrew behind the door which
led into the workshop at the back, Leyland and
Pulteney took up their stand behind a hay-waggon
which afforded them generous concealment. Even as
they did so, a sudden wink of lightning illuminated
the outlines of the garage and the road outside; it
was followed by a distant sound of thunder. The
wind had got up by now, and was moaning uneasily
among the rafters of the building, which was no
better than an open barn.</p>

<p>“Our performance could hardly have been better
staged,” murmured the old gentleman. “I only
regret the absence of a revolver. Not that I should
have any idea how to use a lethal weapon, but it
would give me more sense of derring do. It is
singularly unfortunate that, even if I narrate the events
of this evening to my pupils next term, they will not
believe me. They suspect any information which
comes from such a source. To you, I suppose, this
is an everyday affair?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it, Mr. Pulteney. Most of a
detective’s life is spent sitting in an office filling up
forms, like any bank clerk. I’ve got a revolver with
me myself, but I’m not expecting any shooting.
Brinkman doesn’t strike me as being that kind of
customer.”</p>

<p>“Is it intended that I should precipitate myself
upon the miscreant and overpower him, or where
exactly do my services come in?”</p>

<p>Leyland was rather at a loss to answer. The truth
was, he did not quite trust Mr. Pulteney, and he
thought it best for that reason to keep him by his
side. “Well,” he said, “two heads are better than one
if it comes to a sudden alteration of plans. But there
isn’t going to be any difficulty about catching our
friend. If he comes out by the back, he’ll have my
man shadowing him. If he should come out by the
front, he will have Mr. Eames shadowing him. So
he will be caught between two fires.”</p>

<p>“But it might be difficult for Mr. Eames to catch
him if he were already in the motor-car and driving
it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that, Mr. Pulteney. I’ve
fixed that car so that nobody’s going to get her to
move unless I want him to. It’s the devil of a night,
this. I hope Brinkman won’t funk it.”</p>

<p>They seemed, indeed, to be in the very centre of a
thunder-storm, though it was nowhere quite close
at hand. Every few seconds, from some unexpected
quarter, the whole sky seemed to wink twice in
rapid succession, and with the wink the roofs of
Chilthorpe would suddenly stand out silhouetted,
and a pale glare fell on the white road outside. Rain
lashed upon the roof above them, and for a few
minutes every gutter spouted and every seam in the
tiles let in a pattering flood; then, without a word
of warning, the rain would die down once more.
Occasionally the lightning would manifest itself closer,
great jagged streaks across the sky that looked as if
they were burying themselves in the hill summits
above the town. When the elements were at rest for
a moment, there was an uncanny stillness on every
side; not a dog barked, not a footstep clattered down
the deserted street.</p>

<p>Attuned as their nerves were to the thunder, they
both started as if in panic when the telephone bell
rang. Leyland was at the instrument in a moment,
and heard Angela’s cool voice asking for him at the
other end.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Mr. Leyland? Brinkman has just
left the hotel by the front door. . . . Yes, the <em>front</em>
door. I didn’t see him myself, of course, but my
husband said he came out quite coolly, just looking up
at our window as if to see whether he was watched.
Then I came straight to the telephone. I just looked
in at the bar passage, and found that Mr. Eames was
not there, so I suppose he has followed. Shall I give
any message to the man at the back? Oh, all
right. . . . Yes, he was carrying a despatch-box, which
looks as if he would round up with you before
long. . . . All right, we’ll expect you when we see
you.”</p>

<p>“That sounds all right,” said Leyland to his
companion. “We’d best take cover. Though why on
earth the man came out by the front door—Gad, he
must be a cool customer! To walk out with his bag
from the front door, and wander in here asking for
his car! Keep well behind the lorry, Mr.
Pulteney. . . . Hullo, what’s that?”</p>

<p>The door of the workshop opened, and the
proprietor appeared, drawing on a pair of
motoring-gloves. “Sorry, sir, it’s twenty-five to; got to go and
pick up my gent. Bad night for a drive, with the rain
on your wind-screen, and this lightning blinding you
every other second.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, man, get clear,” said Leyland
impatiently. “He’ll be here in a moment. As you come
back, you might stop at the <i>Load of Mischief</i>,
because we may want a car.”</p>

<p>There was a drumming and a grinding, and the
taxi bounded out on to the roadway. Leyland and
Pulteney drew back behind the lorry, and waited for
the sound of a footfall. They heard the hoot of the
taxi as it passed the turning at the bridge; they
heard the scrape as it changed gears a little late on
the hill road; then the noise died down, and there
was silence. Two flashes of lightning, with the
thunder following quick on them; then silence again.
Five minutes passed, ten minutes, and still they sat
on in the half-darkness. Leyland’s mind was in a
whirl of agitation. Granted that Brinkman had taken
some circuitous route, to avoid observation, was it
likely that he should take so long as this? He had
had time to carry his luggage all round the
township by now. . . . Suddenly, from up the street,
came a sound of running footsteps. Leyland gripped
his revolver and waited with drawn breath.</p>

<h2>Chapter XX. <br/> How Bredon Spent the Evening</h2>

<p>Bredon had undoubtedly secured the best
occupation for the evening. For two whole days
he had missed the feeling of cards between
his hands, and now he returned with a great hunger
to his favourite pastime. True, the circumstances
were not ideal. It was thoughtless of Leyland to have
insisted on his sitting so close to the window; there
was, fortunately, a window-seat, but not generous
enough in its proportions to secure a convenient
lay-out of the cards. The rows, instead of lying flat,
had to climb over downs and gullies in the faded
chintz; the result was an occasional avalanche, and
a corresponding loss of temper. In an ideal world,
Bredon reflected, you would have a large building
like a racquet-court to play patience in, and you
would wheel yourself up and down between the rows
in an invalid’s chair.</p>

<p>There was a soft rustle at the door, and Angela
came in. “Oo, I’ve been feeling so nice and stealthy,”
she said. “Mr. Eames and I crept back down the
lane like burglars. It was better than a cinema, I can
tell you! We dodged round the privet-hedge, and
came in through the back of Mrs. Davis’s kitchen.
And I thought the back stairs would never stop
creaking. Did you hear me coming up?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I did. But you see, I was otherwise
engaged. To a man like Brinkman, on the alert for
every noise, your progress probably sounded like
a charge of cavalry. You’re sure you shut the door
properly? I need hardly say that a sudden draught
would be a disaster to all my best hopes. A little
knitting is indicated for you, Angela, to steady the
mind.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk too much. If Brinky came out and
saw your lips moving it might worry him. Remember,
you’re supposed to be alone in the room. Though
indeed he probably regards you as potty by now in
any case, so it wouldn’t surprise him to see you
talking to yourself. Words cannot depict the shame
I have felt this evening at having such a lazy
husband. Talk of Nero fiddling while Rome was
burning!”</p>

<p>“Say rather, Drake insisting on finishing his game
of bowls. Or was it William Tell? I forget. Anyhow,
this is the fine old British spirit. What’s the word?
Not undaunted—imperturbable, that’s what I mean.
The myrmidons of Scotland Yard bustle to and fro
outside; the great detective sits calmly within, with
all the strings in his hands. My nets begin to close
tighter round them, Watson. Dash it all, I believe
Pulteney’s let me down. Where’s his other two of
spades?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be unpleasant, but you will
perhaps allow me to remind you that you are supposed
to be on the lookout. If Brinky comes out in front,
you are to report to me. And how are you to see him,
if you will go scavenging about under the
window-seat like that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll jolly well have to find my two of
spades, then, while I keep an eye on the street. Fair
division of labour. Watchman, what of the night?
There’s going to be a jolly fine thunder-storm. Did
you see that flash? I deduce that there will shortly
be a slight roll of thunder. There, what did I tell
you?”</p>

<p>“It’s not so much the innate laziness of the man,”
murmured Angela, as if to herself, “it’s his
self-sufficiency! Here’s your beastly two of spades; don’t
lose it again. You ought to have the cards tied round
your neck with a piece of string. I say, aren’t you
excited? Do you think Brinky will show fight when
they nab him in the garage?”</p>

<p>“Don’t fluster me. I wish to be secluded from the
world. Here before me lies a very pretty problem,
represented by two hundred and eight pieces of
pasteboard. Behind that, in the dim background of my
half-awake consciousness, lies a very pretty
problem in detection. It is my boast that I can do both
at once. But how am I to do either if women will
chatter at me?”</p>

<p>“Passengers are requested not to speak to the
man at the wheel. All right, Aunty, go on with your
silly game. I’m going to knit. It doesn’t feel quite
womanly to knit, somehow, with a thing like you
in the room.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a while, as Bredon sat over
his cards, with an occasional glance at the street
below him. There is said to be a man who has
invented a Chinese typewriter; and since (they tell
us) every word in the Chinese language has its own
symbol—the fault of Confucius, for not thinking
of letters—the machine is said to be of the size and
shape of a vast organ, and the typist runs to and fro,
pulling out a stop here, pressing down a pedal there,
in a whirl of activity. Not otherwise did Bredon
appear when he saw the possibilities of a particular
gambit in his patience; then he would sit for a while
lost in thought, puzzling out combinations for the
future. Below him, the street lay in an unearthly
half-darkness. Lamps should not have been needed
by this time on a June evening, but the thick mantle
of clouds had taken away all that was left of the
sun’s departing influence, and it was a twilit world
that lay below. He could see a broad splash of light
from the front door, and, further along, the
mellower radiance diffused by the bar windows, with
their drawn red blinds. From time to time a
sudden flare of lightning illuminated the whole prospect,
and shamed these human lights into insignificance.</p>

<p>“Angela,” said Bredon suddenly, without turning
round, “I don’t know if it interests you at all, but
a stealthy figure has crept out into the moonlight.
At least, there isn’t any moonlight, but still, those
irritatingly twirled moustaches, that supercilious
pince-nez—can it be? It is—our old friend
Brinkman. He carries a despatch-box, but no other
luggage. He is passing down the street in the direction
of the turning; perhaps making for the garage—who
shall say? He is looking round at this window. Ha!
’tis well, I am observed. Anyhow, it’s up to you to go
to the telephone this time.”</p>

<p>Angela’s self-possession was more of a pose. She
sprang up in a hurry, dropping her knitting as she
rose, and threw the door open silently but swiftly;
then, as silently, as swiftly, it shut again behind her.
But not before irretrievable damage had been done.
The evening was full of those sudden gusts and
air-currents which a thunder-storm brings with it. One
of these, synchronizing with the sudden opening of
the door, neatly lifted up three of the cards from the
window-seat, and swept them out into the open air.</p>

<p>Bredon was intensely annoyed, and somewhat
puzzled as to his duty. On the one hand, it was
impossible to go on with the game when three cards,
whose values he could not remember, were missing
from a row. On the other hand, Leyland’s
instructions had been explicit; he was to sit at the window
without stirring. Then common sense came to his aid.
After all, Brinkman was no longer in sight; even if
he were still watching from the corner, he would
never suspect that a movement in the room upstairs
portended discovery. With a great effort Bredon
heaved himself up from the chair into which he had
sunk, opened the door delicately for fear of fresh
draughts, and in half a minute’s time was searching
before the front of the inn for his truant
pasteboard.</p>

<p>The king of spades, good. And here was the three
of diamonds. But there was one other card; he was
certain of it. A friendly flash of lightning gave him a
sudden snapshot of the road; Brinkman was out of
sight; another figure, Eames presumably, was
already making for the turning. But there was no
card in the street; no deceptive fragments of paper,
even, to catch the eye. He looked round, baffled.
Then his eye caught the sight of an open
ground-floor window, that of the “best room.” Could the
fluttering runaway have dived indoors again? He
put his head in through the window; there it lay,
close to the occasional table with the photograph
album on it. He was back through the front door in
an instant, and making his way upstairs again with
his prize.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he said, aloud, as he regained his
room, “could that possibly be it? That would mean,
of course . . . hang it all, what would that mean?
Ah! That’s more like it.” The patience lay all round
him, forgotten for the moment; his eyes sparkled,
his hands gripped the arms of his chair.</p>

<p>When Angela came back from the telephone, she
was astonished at the change that had come over her
husband. He was standing on the fender with his
back to the empty grate, swinging himself to and
fro while he carolled a snatch from an out-of-date
musical repertoire:</p>

<blockquote class="verse"><div>

  <p>“All the girls began to cry, ‘Hi, hi, hi, Mister Mackay,</p>
  <p>Take us with you when you fly back to the Isle of Skye,’ ”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">were the actual words that greeted her entrance.</p>

<p>“Miles, dear,” she expostulated, “whatever’s the
matter? Have you got it out?”</p>

<p>“What, the patience? No, I don’t think the
patience is coming out just yet. But I’ve got a very
strong suspicion that our little detective mystery is
coming out. As you are up, I wonder if it would be
troubling you too much to ask you to step down to
Mrs. Davis and ask her if she ever cut any
sandwiches for Mr. Brinkman?”</p>

<p>“My poor, poor dear!” said Angela; but she went.
She knew the signs of a victory in her husband’s
erratic deportment. He was still crooning softly to
himself when she came back with her message.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Davis says that she doesn’t remember ever
to have cut any ‘sangwiches,’ not for Mr. Brinkman
she didn’t. Mr. Pulteney, now, he often takes a nice
‘sangwich’ with him when he goes out fishing. Not
that she always makes them herself, because the girl
cuts as nice a ‘sangwich’ as you’d wish to see. But
Mr. Brinkman he didn’t order any ‘sangwiches,’ not
all this week he hasn’t. That’s all the message. At
least, I came away at that point.”</p>

<p>“Good! The case progresses. Let me call your
attention to this singular absence of ‘sangwich’-cutting
on the part of Mrs. Davis. Angela, I’m right on the
track of the beastly thing, and you mustn’t disturb
me.”</p>

<p>“Have you really worked it all out?”</p>

<p>“No, not quite all; but I’m in the sort of stage
where the great detective says, ‘Good God, what a
blind bat I have been!’ As a matter of fact, I don’t
think I’ve been a blind bat at all. On the contrary,
I think it’s dashed clever of me to have got hold
of the thing now. It’s more than you have.”</p>

<p>“Miles, you’re not to be odious. Tell me all about
it, and I’ll see what I think of you.”</p>

<p>“Who was it laughed at me for staying at home
and playing patience while other people did the
work? No, you shan’t hear about it; besides I
haven’t fitted it all together yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, you might tell me whether you’ve
won the forty quid or lost it.”</p>

<p>“Not a word shall you get out of me at present.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make Mr. Leyland arrest you and
torture you with thumb-screws. By the way, I
wonder what Mr. Leyland’s doing? Brinky must have
got to the garage by now, and I should have thought
he would have brought him straight back here.”</p>

<p>“The garage? Oh, yes. At least, wait a minute. . . .
Of course, now I come to think of it, there’s
no real reason to suppose that Brinkman meant to
take the car out at all.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch21">

<h2>Chapter XXI. <br/> How Eames Spent the Evening</h2>

<p>Eames stood behind the window of the passage
into the bar parlour, making sure that there
was no light behind him to show a silhouette.
Yes, there was no doubt, it was Brinkman who had
stepped out into the twilight of the street;
Brinkman with a despatch-box in his hand; Brinkman
on the run. He waited until the street corner hid
the fugitive from view, then crammed on his soft
hat and followed. He was not an expert at this sort
of game, but fortunately there was not much to
be done. Brinkman would obviously make for the
garage, and when he had passed through the open
doors of it, it would be easy for him, Eames, to slink
up behind and post himself outside the gateway to
prevent a sudden rush. Hang it all, though, why
hadn’t the man gone out by the back lane?</p>

<p>And then he saw that he had counted on his luck
too soon. Brinkman had reached the turning, and
had not made for the garage after all. He had turned
his back on it, and was starting out on the
Pullford Road, the road toward the gorge and the Long
Pool. This was outside all their calculations; what
on earth could the man be up to? Not only was he
deserting his car, he was deserting the garage, and
with it all the available petrol-power of Chilthorpe.
He could not be walking to Pullford, a distance
of twenty miles more or less. He could hardly even
be walking to Lowgill Junction, eight miles off,
though that would, of course, bring him onto the
main line. Chilthorpe Station would be hopeless at
this time of night; no strand remained to connect it
with civilization. No, if Brinkman took this road,
he must be taking it only to return along it.</p>

<p>And yet, was it safe to reckon on that? Was it
safe to make straight for the garage, and warn
Leyland of what was happening? If he did that, he must
let Brinkman out of his sight; and his orders were
not to let Brinkman out of his sight. Eames was in
the habit of obeying orders, and he obeyed. It
would need cautious going, for, if Brinkman turned
in his tracks, it was not unlikely that he would walk
straight into the arms of his pursuer. Very cautiously
then, flattening himself in doorways or hiding behind
clumps of broom and furze on the roadside, Eames
stalked his man at a distance of some thirty yards.
It was difficult work in the half-darkness, but those
sudden, revealing flashes of lightning made it
unsafe to go nearer. They had left the last of the
houses, and were now reaching the forked roads a
little way up the hill. If Brinkman took the lower
road, it must be Lowgill Junction he was making
for; that would make easy work for his pursuers,
who could ride him down in a fast motor. Surely it
could not be that; surely he could not be turning his
back on the motor and the thousand pounds!</p>

<p>No, he was not making for Lowgill. He took the
hill turning instead; that led either to the railway
station or across the moors to Pullford. In either
case every step was taking the hunted man farther
away from help. “If he goes as far as the first
milestone,” Eames said to himself, “I’ll defy my orders
and cut back to the garage, so that they can get the
car out and follow him. Confound it all, what’s the
man doing now?”</p>

<p>Brinkman had left the high road, and was making
his way deliberately down the field-path that led
to the gorge. This was worse than ever; the path
was steep, and Eames, although he carried an
electric torch which Bredon had lent him, did not
dare to use it for fear of betraying himself. He could
not guess the significance of this last move. There
was no road Brinkman could be making for, unless
he returned to this same road at the other end of the
gorge, a few hundred yards higher up. Was it safe
to wait at the beginning of the path? Was it safe
to follow along the road, flanking his movements
from above? Once more Eames had to fall back upon
his orders. There was only one way of keeping his
man in sight, and that was to stick to his heels. It
would mean, probably, some nasty stumbles in the
half-darkness, but it was too late to consider that.
At least, the fir-trees and the bracken made it easier
to follow unseen. And the fir-trees kept off a little
of the rain, which was now driving fiercely upon his
overcoat, and clogging the knees of his trousers with
damp. Never mind, he had his orders.</p>

<p>Any kind of scenery achieves dignity in a
thunder-storm; but rocky scenery in particular is ennobled
by the combination. Under those quivering flashes,
the two sides of the valley with the river running in
between looked like the wings of a gigantic
butterfly shaking off the pitiless dew that was falling on
them. The opening of the gorge itself, with the slant
of the shadows as the lightning’s glare failed to reach
its depths, was like an illustration to the “Inferno.”
The rain on the hillside turned to diamond drops as
it reflected the flashes; “the fire ran along the
ground,” thought Eames to himself. It was a sight
to make a man forget his present occupations, if
those occupations had been less pressing and less
sinister.</p>

<p>Brinkman himself either did not carry a torch or
did not use it. His pace was leisurely on the whole,
though he seemed to quicken his step a little when
the church clock struck half-past eight. By that time
he was already at the opening of the gorge. This took
him out of sight, and Eames, secure in the cover
which the dark tufts of fern afforded, ran forward
over the spongy grass to creep up nearer to him.
The gorge itself, ominous at all times, was
particularly formidable under such skies as these. The
half-light enabled one to see the path, but (to a man
unaccustomed to his surroundings) suggested the
ever-present possibility of losing one’s foothold; and
when the lightning came, it revealed the angry
torrent beneath with unpleasant vividness. Fortunately
the noise of the elements deadened the sound of feet
on the hard rock. Eames hesitated for one moment,
and then followed along the narrow path that led up
the gorge.</p>

<p>He could just see the dim figure that went before
him as it reached the wider foothold at the middle
of the gorge, where Brinkman and Bredon had
interrupted their conversation to comment on the shape
of the rocks, Then it halted, and Eames halted too;
he was now less than twenty yards behind, and he
was at the last turn in the rock which could promise
him any shelter from observation. He did well to
halt, for while he stood there a huge tree of lightning
seemed to flash out from the opposite side of the
valley, and, for an interval which could be counted in
seconds, the whole landscape lay open to view as if
in hard daylight.</p>

<p>Eames’s eyes were riveted upon a single spot; he
had thoughts for nothing but the sudden and
inexplicable behaviour of Brinkman. In that flash, he
saw the little man leaping up in the air, his right
hand outstretched at full arm’s length, as if to reach
the top, or something behind the top, of that very
ledge which in the morning he had compared to the
rack in a railway carriage. Indeed, Brinkman himself
looked not unlike some juvenile traveller who just
cannot reach the parcel he wants to bring down, and
must needs jump for it. What was the object of
Brinkman’s manœuvre did not appear, nor even
whether he was trying to take something down from
the ledge or to put something onto it. But the
grotesque attitude, momentarily revealed in that single
spotlight of the thunder-storm, was perfectly
unmistakable.</p>

<p>The prolonged glare left Eames momentarily
blinded, like one who has just passed a car with very
powerful headlights. When he saw clearly again, the
dark figure under the ledge was gone. Could
Brinkman have taken alarm? He had looked backward
after his absurd leap, like a man who felt he was
pursued. In any case, Eames must press forward
now, or he would lose his quarry altogether. . . .
By the time he had reached the ledge a new flash
came and showed him, at the very end of the gorge,
Brinkman running as if for his life. There was no
more sense in concealment; he must mend his own
pace too; and that was impossible, on this narrow
shelf of rock, unless he lit his torch. Lighting it, he
took one look at the ledge toward which Brinkman
had been jumping, and, by reason of his superior
height, saw without difficulty an envelope which
looked as if it must be the explanation of
Brinkman’s gesture. He reached it with little trouble, put
it in his pocket, and ran. As he ran he heard the
hum of a motor engine on the road above him.</p>

<p>The scramble up the bank at the further end of
the gorge was less formidable than he had feared, for
he kept his torch alight, and he made a pace very
creditable for his years. But even as he breasted the
level of the roadway, he saw a car climbing the hill,
doubtless carrying Brinkman with it. He cried to
the driver to stop, but a volley of thunder drowned
his utterance. He turned impotently, and began
running down the hill: in ten minutes or so, at this pace,
he should be at the garage. But as he ran he took the
envelope out of his pocket and scanned its
superscription by the light of his torch. It read: “To His
Lordship the Bishop of Pullford. Private and
Confidential.” He thrust it away, wondering; but a
short-winded man running has no taste for puzzles.
Would it be any use turning in to the <i>Load of
Mischief</i>, and letting somebody else carry his message
the rest of the way? Hardly; and a double set of
explanations would be a waste of precious time.</p>

<p>He reached the garage panting too heavily for
speech, and, in answer to a challenge in Leyland’s
voice, turned his own torch on himself for
identification. Then, leaning wearily against the front of the
lorry, he blurted out his explanations. “He’s
gone—motor-car—toward Pullford—couldn’t stop
him—better follow him up—didn’t look a fast car—lost
him at the gorge—take me with you, and I’ll
explain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but curse it all, has he made for Pullford
or for Lowgill? We must try Lowgill; we can
telegraph from there, anyhow, and have him stopped.
Hullo, who next?”</p>

<p>Angela had rushed in, hatless, to announce
Breton’s cryptic observation about the car. She
knew his mysterious moods, and felt that it was
best to make straight for Leyland, especially as her
car was the only fast one in the township. “Right you
are,” she said, when the situation had been
outlined to her; “I’ll drive you both into Lowgill; jump
up.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pulteney,” said Leyland, “do you mind
going to the stables at the back of the inn to find
my man who’s waiting there? Tell him what’s
happened, say he’s to get onto the telephone, break
into the post-office if necessary, and warn Pullford
and Lowgill. He may just have time to head the man
off. Oh, by the way, he won’t know who you are,
may take you for Brinkman. Say, ‘Here we are
again,’ loudly—do you mind?—when you’re outside
the stable.”</p>

<p>“It will be a novel experience,” said Mr. Pulteney.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXII. <br/> At a Standstill</h2>

<p>It was nearly eleven o’clock before Angela
returned; and, since she resolutely refused to
disclose anything about her movements unless
Bredon divulged his theory, there were no
explanations at all that night. “It’s not that I’m inquisitive,”
she explained, “but I do want to break you of that
bad habit of obstinacy.” “Well, well,” said Bredon,
“if you choose to drag my name in the dust, not
to mention my car, by these midnight expeditions,
there’s no more to be said.” And no more was said.</p>

<p>They found Leyland already at breakfast when
they came down. He had been up, he said, since six,
making inquiries in every conceivable direction. “I
must say,” he added, “it wasn’t Mrs. Bredon’s fault
we didn’t catch our man last night.”</p>

<p>“The woman was reckless, I suppose, as usual?”
asked Bredon.</p>

<p>“Oo, no,” said Angela in self-defence, “I only got
her going a little.”</p>

<p>“It’s eight miles to Lowgill by the signposts,”
said Leyland, “and a little more in real life. Mrs.
Bredon did it—and, remember, the gradients are far
worse than those on the Pullford road—in just over
twelve minutes. But we’d no luck. The up-train from
Lowgill—it’s the only one of the big expresses that
stops there—had just gone before we arrived. And,
of course, we couldn’t tell whether Brinkman had
gone on it or not. His car passed us on the road, only
a few hundred yards from the station, and we hadn’t
time to stop.”</p>

<p>“What car was he in?”</p>

<p>“That’s the devilish part of it—I’m sorry, Mrs.
Bredon.”</p>

<p>“That’s the damnable part of it,” amended
Angela serenely. “It was the car from the garage; and
it sailed out at twenty-five minutes to nine, under
Mr. Leyland’s nose. Even the sleuthlike brain of
Mr. Pulteney didn’t realize what was happening.”</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Leyland, “it was a very
well-arranged plant. Brinkman had rung up earlier
in the afternoon, asking the garage to meet the late
train which gets in to Chilthorpe at 8.40. He gave
the name of Merrick. The garage naturally asked
no questions as to where the message came from;
they’re always meeting that late train. And, of
course, they assumed that there was somebody
<em>arriving</em> by that train. Then, when the man had got
a little way out of the town, just above the gorge
there, he was stopped on the road by a passenger
with a despatch-box in his hand, who was walking
in the direction of Chilthorpe, as if coming from
the station. He waved at the car, and asked if it
was for Mr. Merrick; then he explained that he was
in a great hurry, because he wanted to catch the
express at Lowgill. It was a perfectly normal thing
to want to do, and there wasn’t much time to do it
in; so the man went all out, and just caught the
express in time. He didn’t know who we were when
we passed him, and it wasn’t till he got back to
Chilthorpe that he realized what he’d done.
Meanwhile, who’s to say whether Brinkman stopped at
Lowgill, or really got into the express?”</p>

<p>“Or took the later train back to Pullford?”
suggested Bredon.</p>

<p>“No, we kept a good lookout to see that he didn’t
do that. But the other uncertainty remained, and it
was fatal to my plans. I sent word to London to
have the train watched when it got in, giving a
description of Brinkman; but of course that’s never
any use. In half an hour or so I shall get a telegram
from London to say they’ve found nothing.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have the express stopped down the
line?”</p>

<p>“I’d have liked to, of course. But it’s a mail train,
and it’s always full of rich people in first-class
carriages. Give me a local train on a Saturday night,
and I’ll have it stopped and searched and all the
passengers held up for two hours, and not so much
as a letter to the papers about it. But if you stop
one of these big expresses on the chance of
heading off a criminal, and nothing comes of it, there’ll
be questions asked in the House of Commons. And I
was in a bad position, you see. I can’t prove that
Brinkman was a murderer. Not at present, anyhow.
If he’d run off in Mottram’s car, I could have
arrested him for car-stealing, but he hadn’t. Why, he
even paid Mrs. Davis’s bill!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say he asked for his bill
yesterday afternoon, and we never heard of it?”</p>

<p>“No, he calculated it out exactly, left a tip of
two shillings for the barmaid, and went off leaving
the money on his chest of drawers.”</p>

<p>“What about his suitcase?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t his, it was Mottram’s. He carried off
all his own things in the despatch-box. Apart from
the fact that he gave a false name to the garage
people, his exit was quite <i>en règle</i>. And it’s
dangerous to stop a train and arrest a man like that. Added
to which, it was perfectly possible that he was lying
doggo at Lowgill.”</p>

<p>It was at this point that Mr. Pulteney sailed into
the room. The old gentleman was rubbing his hands
briskly in the enjoyment of retrospect; he had
scarce any need of breakfast, you would have said,
so richly was he chewing the cud of his experiences
overnight. “What a day I have spent!” he
exclaimed. “I have examined a motor-car, and even
opened part of its mechanism, without asking the
owner’s leave. I have been suspected of murder. I
have set up in an extremely draughty garage,
waiting to pounce upon a criminal. And, to crown it all,
I have approached a total stranger with the words
‘Here we are again.’ Really life has nothing more
to offer me. But where is Mr. Eames?”</p>

<p>“We took him to Lowgill with us,” explained
Angela, “and when he got there he insisted on taking
the late train back to Pullford. He said he had
something to talk over with the Bishop. He has left some
pyjamas and a toothbrush here as hostages, and
says he will look in on us in the course of the day
to reclaim them. So you’ll see him again.”</p>

<p>“A remarkable man. A shrewd judge of
character. He recognized me at once as a man of
reflection. God bless my soul! Do I understand that
Mrs. Davis has provided us with sausages?”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful, isn’t it?” said Angela. “She must
have felt that the occasion had to be marked out
somehow. And she was so pleased at having her bill
paid. I don’t think Brinky can have been such an
unpleasant man, after all.”</p>

<p>“Believe me,” said Leyland earnestly, “there is
no greater mistake than to suppose your criminal
is a man lost to all human feelings. It is perfectly
possible for Brinkman to have murdered his master,
and have been prepared to run off with a car and a
thousand pounds which didn’t belong to him, and
yet to have shrunk from the prospect of leaving an
honest woman like Mrs. Davis the poorer for his
visit. We are men, you see, and we are not made
all in one piece.”</p>

<p>“But how odd of him to pop off into the gorge
like that! I mean, it’s a very jolly place, they tell
me; and we know Brinky admired the scenery of
it, because he told my husband so. But isn’t
it rather odd of him to have wanted to take a long,
last lingering look at it before he bolted for South
America?”</p>

<p>“It is perfectly possible that it may have had a
fascination for him,” assented Leyland. “But I think
his conduct was more reasonable than you suppose.
After all, by coming up at the farther end of the
gorge he managed to make it look quite natural when
the motor found him walking in the direction of
Chilthorpe. And, more than that, I have little doubt
that he knew he was followed. Eames is a most
capable fellow, but he must, I think, have followed
his man a little carelessly, and so given himself
away. Brinkman probably thought that it was
Bredon who was following him.”</p>

<p>“Because he did it so badly, you mean?”
suggested Angela. “Miles, you shouldn’t throw bread
at breakfast, it’s rude.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that. I meant that he had reason
to believe Mr. Eames was at the cinema, whereas
he knew Bredon was in the house, and saw him
sitting in a window that looks down over the street.
Almost inevitably he must have supposed that it
was the watcher in the front of the house who had
followed in his tracks.”</p>

<p>“It’s worse than that,” said Bredon. “I’m afraid,
you see, when my wife went out of the room, she
opened the door in that careless way she has, and
three of my cards fell into the street below. Well,
I thought Brinkman had disappeared; there was no
sign of him. So I went downstairs and retrieved
the cards, thinking it couldn’t do any harm. But I’ve
been wondering since whether Brinkman wasn’t still
watching, and whether my disappearance from the
window didn’t give him the first hint that he was
being followed. I’m awfully sorry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t expect it made any difference. He
was a cool hand, you see. I suppose he thought your
sitting in the window must be a trap, and that the
house was really watched at the back. He wasn’t
far wrong there, of course.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he was not,” assented Mr. Pulteney.
“You seem to me to have posted a singularly
lynx-eyed gentleman in the stables.”</p>

<p>“And so, you see, he thought he’d brazen it out.
He reckoned on being followed, but that didn’t
matter to him as long as the man behind was a good
distance off, and as long as he himself made sure
of picking up his car at the right moment. The whole
thing was monstrously mismanaged on my part. But,
you see, I made absolutely certain that he was going
for Mottram’s car, in which he’d obviously made all
the necessary preparations. Even now I can’t
understand how he consented so calmly to leave the car
behind him. Unless, of course, he spotted that we
were watching the garage, and knew that it would
be unsafe. But he must be crippled for money
without his thousand.”</p>

<p>“My husband,” said Angela mischievously,
“seemed to know beforehand that he wouldn’t go
off in Mottram’s car.”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the way,” asked Leyland, “how was
that?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, it ought to have occurred to me earlier.
It never dawned on me till the moment when I
mentioned it, and of course then it was too late. But it
was merely the result of a reasoning process which
had been going on in my own mind. I had been
trying to work things out, and it seemed to me that
I had arrived at an explanation which would cover
all the facts. And that explanation, though it didn’t
exclude the possibility that Brinkman intended to
skip with the thousand and the car, didn’t make it
absolutely necessary that he should mean to.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re still hankering after suicide?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“But, hang it all, though there’s little enough that’s
clear, it’s surely clear by now that Brinkman was a
wrong ’un. And if he was a wrong ’un, what can his
motive have been throughout unless he was
Mottram’s murderer? I don’t associate innocence with a
sudden flitting at nightfall, and a bogus name given
in when you order the car to take you to the
station.”</p>

<p>“Still, it’s not enough to have a general impression
that a man is a wrong ’un, and hang him on the
strength of it. You must discover a motive for which
he would have done the murder, and a method by
which he could have done it. Are you prepared to
produce those?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Leyland. “I don’t profess to have
all the details of the case at my fingers’ ends; but
I’m prepared to give what seems to me a rational
explanation of all the circumstances. And it’s an
explanation which contends that Mottram met his
death by murder.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch23">

<h2>Chapter XXIII. <br/> Leyland’s Account of It All</h2>

<p>“Of course, as to the motive,” went on
Leyland, “I am not absolutely sure that I can
point to a single one. But a combination
of motives is sufficient, if the motives are
comparatively strong ones. On the whole, I am inclined to put
the thousand pounds first. For a rich man, Mottram
did not pay his secretary very well; and at times, I
understand, he talked of parting with him.
Brinkman knew that the sum was in Mottram’s
possession, for it was he himself who cashed the cheque
at the bank. It was only a day or two before they
came down here. On the other hand, I doubt if
Brinkman knew where the money was; plainly
Mottram didn’t trust him very much, or he wouldn’t
have taken the trouble to sew the money in the
cushions of the car. When I first found the cache, I
assumed that Brinkman knew of its existence, and
that was one of the reasons why I felt so certain that
he would make straight for the garage. Now, I’m
more inclined to think he fancied he would find the
money among Mottram’s effects, which he must have
hoped to examine in the interval before the arrival
of the police.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think the Euthanasia had
anything to do with it after all?” asked Bredon.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say that. There’s no doubt that
Brinkman was a rabid anti-clerical—Eames was talking to
me about that—and I think it’s quite likely he would
have welcomed, in any case, an opportunity of
getting Mottram out of the way provided that the death
looked like suicide. The appearance of suicide would
have the advantage, as we have all seen, that the
Indescribable wouldn’t pay up. But he wanted, in
any case, to give the murder the appearance of
suicide, in order to save his own skin.”</p>

<p>“Then you think both motives were present to his
mind?”</p>

<p>“Probably. I suppose there is little doubt that he
knew of the danger to Mottram’s health, and the
consequent danger, from his point of view, that the
money would go to the Pullford Diocese. But I don’t
think that motive would have been sufficient, if he
hadn’t reckoned on getting away with a thousand
pounds which didn’t belong to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s pass the motive,” said Bredon. “I’m
interested to hear your account of the method.”</p>

<p>“Our mistake from the first has been that of not
accepting the facts. We have tried to fit the facts into
our scheme, instead of letting the facts themselves
guide us. From the first we were faced with what
seemed to be a hopeless contradiction. The locked
door seemed to make it certain that Mottram was
alone when he died. The fact that the gas was turned
off seemed to make it clear that Mottram was <em>not</em>
alone when he died. There was ground for suspecting
either suicide or murder; the difficulty was to make
the whole complex of facts fit into either view. We
had made a mistake, I repeat, in not taking the facts
for our guide. The door was locked; that is a fact.
Therefore Mottram was alone from the time he
went to bed until the time when the door was broken
in. And at the time when the door was broken in
the gas was found turned off. Somebody must have
turned it off, and in order to do so he must have
been in the room. There was only one person in the
room—Mottram. Therefore it was Mottram who
turned the gas off.”</p>

<p>“You mean in his last dying moments?”</p>

<p>“No, such a theory would be fantastic. Mottram
clearly turned the gas off in the ordinary way.
Therefore, now, mark this, it was not the gas in
Mottram’s room which poisoned Mottram.”</p>

<p>“But hang it all, if it wasn’t in his room”——</p>

<p>“When I say that, I mean it was not the gas
which turned on and off in Mottram’s room. For
that gas was turned off. Therefore it must have been
some independent supply of gas which poisoned
him.”</p>

<p>“Such as?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the solution occur to you yet? The room,
remember, is very low, and the window rather high
up in the wall. What is to prevent a supply of gas
being introduced from outside and from above?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! You don’t mean you think that
Brinkman”——</p>

<p>“Brinkman had the room immediately above.
Since his hurried departure, I have had opportunities
of taking a better look round it. I was making some
experiments there early this morning. In the first
place, I find that it is possible for a man leaning
out of the window in Brinkman’s room to control
with a stick the position of the window in Mottram’s
room—provided always that the window is swinging
loose. He can ensure at will that Mottram’s window
stands almost shut, or almost fully open.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that’s true.”</p>

<p>“I find, further, that Brinkman’s room, like
Mottram’s, was supplied with a double apparatus, with
a bracket on the wall and with a movable standard
lamp. But whereas the main tap in Mottram’s room
was near the door, and the tube which connected the
gas with the standard lamp was meant to allow the
lamp to be put on the writing-table, in Brinkman’s
room it was the other way. The main tap was near
the window, and the tube which connected it with
the standard lamp was meant to allow the lamp to
be placed at the bedside. The main tap in
Brinkman’s room is barely a yard from the window. And
the tube of the standard lamp is some four yards
long.</p>

<p>“When Mottram went to bed, Brinkman went up
to his room. He knew that Mottram had taken a
sleeping draught; that in half an hour or so he would
be asleep, and unconscious of all that went on. So,
leaving a prudent interval of time, Brinkman
proceeded as follows. He took the tube off from the
foot of the standard lamp; that is quite an easy
matter. Then he took the tube to the window.
With a walking-stick he slightly opened Mottram’s
window down below—it had been left ajar. And
through the opening thus made he let down the tube
till the end of it was in Mottram’s room. Then, with
the walking-stick, he shut the window again,
except for a mere crack which was needed to let
the tube through. Then he turned on the guide-tap
which fed his standard lamp, and the gas began to
flow through into Mottram’s room. That coil of
tube was a venomous serpent, which could poison
Mottram in his sleep, behind locked doors, and
be removed again without leaving any trace when
its deadly work was done.</p>

<p>“Whether it was through carelessness on
Brinkman’s part, or whether it was owing to the wind,
that the window swung right open and became fixed
there, I don’t know. In any case, it did not make
much difference to his plans. He had now succeeded
in bringing off the murder, and in a way which
it would have been hard for anybody to suspect.
But there was one more difficulty to be got over: In
order to remove the suspicion of murder, and to
make the suspicion of suicide inevitable, it was
necessary to turn on the gas in Mottram’s room. Now,
there was no implement Brinkman could employ
which would enable him to reach Mottram’s gas-tap.
He depended, therefore, on bluff. He made sure that
he would be summoned by the Boots when the
locked door forbade entrance. He would force his
way in with the Boots; he would make straight
for the tap, and <em>pretend</em> to turn it off. Would
anybody doubt that it was he who had turned it off?
The room was full of gas fumes, and even a man of
more intelligence than the Boots would naturally
leap to the conclusion that the gas <em>must</em> have been
on, in order to account for the fumes.</p>

<p>“His plan, you see, was perfect in its preparations.
It was an unexpected interference that prevented
its coming off. When Brinkman was telling you
the story, he pretended that it was he who saw Dr.
Ferrers outside, and suggested calling him in.
Actually it was the Boots, according to the story he
himself tells, who drew attention to the presence of Dr.
Ferrers and suggested his being called in. This point,
which was of capital importance, was slurred over at
the inquest because nobody saw the bearing of it.
Brinkman did not want Dr. Ferrers to be there; yet
the suggestion was too reasonable to be turned down.
Brinkman stationed himself with his shoulder close
to the lock, while Ferrers leant his weight against
the door at the other end, nearest the hinges.
Assuming that the lock would give, Brinkman could
rush into the room first and go through the motions
of turning off the gas without attracting suspicion.</p>

<p>“Actually, it was the hinges which gave. Dr. Ferrers,
realizing that the gas must be turned off in order
to clear the air, ran straight to the tap over the <i>débris</i>
of the broken door before Brinkman could get
at it. And Ferrers naturally exclaimed in surprise
when he found the tap already turned off. The Boots
heard his exclamation; Brinkman’s plan had fallen
through. There was nothing for it but to pretend that
the tap was a loose one, and that Dr. Ferrers had
himself turned it off without noticing it. That was
the story, Bredon, which he put up to you. We know
that it was a lie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite see,” said Bredon, “how all this
works in with the sandwiches and whisky. In the
motor, I mean. What was the idea of them?”</p>

<p>“Well, Brinkman’s original idea must clearly have
been flight. That was, I take it, when he realized the
difficulty which had been created for him by his
failure to reach the gas first. It must have been
before I arrived that he made these preparations—stored
the motor with food and painted out the
number-plate at the back. I’ve had him under pretty
careful observation ever since I came here. But that
was Tuesday afternoon, and I have no doubt that
his preparations had been made by then.”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t he skip?”</p>

<p>“I think he was worried by my arrival. You see,
he tried to palm off the suicide story on me, and I
didn’t fall to it. If he skipped, he would confirm
me in my conviction that there had been a murder,
and, although he himself might get off scotfree, it
would mean that your Indescribable people would
have to pay up to the Bishop of Pullford. He couldn’t
stand the idea of that. He preferred to hang about
here, trying to convince you, because you were
already half-convinced, that the case was one of
suicide and that the company was not liable.”</p>

<p>“In fact, he just waited for the funeral, and then
made off?”</p>

<p>“No, he waited until he thought he wasn’t watched.
It’s a rum business, shadowing a man; you don’t
want him to see exactly who is shadowing him, or
where the man is who is shadowing him; but you
do, very often, want him to know that he is
shadowed, because that makes him lose his head and give
himself away. Now, Brinkman didn’t know what I
suspected and didn’t, I think, know about my two
men at the <i>Swan</i>. But I contrived to let him see that
he was under observation, and that it wasn’t safe
for him to go far out of my sight. It’s an old game:
you give a man that impression, and then you
suddenly let on that he is free—for the moment at any
rate. He seizes his chance, and, with luck, you catch
him. He really thought yesterday evening that you
were the only person watching the front of the house.
But he was clever enough, confound him, to see that
there might be danger for him in the garage. So he
rang up, ordering a car to meet the 8.40 at
Chilthorpe Station, and then made his
arrangements—uncommonly good ones—for boarding the car en
route. And nobody’s to blame, exactly, but I gravely
fear that the murderer has got off scotfree.”</p>

<p>As if in confirmation of his words, the maid
came in with a telegram. He opened it and crushed
it in his hand. “As I thought,” he said; “they
searched the train at the terminus and didn’t find
their man. They may watch the ports, but I doubt
if they’ll get him now. It’s a rotten business.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ve explained everything,” said
Bredon, “I mean, about Brinkman’s movements
after the murder. Indeed, I know for a fact that
you haven’t explained everything; partly because
you don’t know everything. But I think your account
of Brinkman’s movements that night is
extraordinarily ingenious, and I only wish it were true. I
wish it were true, I mean, because it would have
brought us up, for once in our lives, against a really
clever criminal. But, you see, there’s one thing which
is fatal to all your theory. You haven’t explained
why the gas-tap showed the mark where Mottram
turned it on and didn’t show the mark where
Mottram turned it off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I admit that’s puzzling. Still, one can
imagine circumstances”——</p>

<p>“One can imagine circumstances, but one can’t fit
them onto the facts. If the gas had been quite close
to Mottram’s bed, and he had had a stick by his side,
he might have turned off the tap with the stick; I’ve
known slack men do that. But the gas wasn’t near
enough for that. Or, again, if Mottram had gone to
bed in gloves, he might have turned off the tap
with gloves on; but he didn’t. The tap was stiff;
it was stiff both when you turned it on and when
you turned it off; and there must, in reason, have
been some slight trace left if that gas was turned
off by a man’s naked fingers. Therefore it wasn’t
turned off by a man’s naked fingers. Therefore it
wasn’t turned off by Mottram, or by anybody who
had any business to turn it off. It was turned off by
somebody who had a secret end to serve in doing so.”</p>

<p>“You mean a criminal end?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that. I said a secret end. Your
view doesn’t explain that; and because it doesn’t
explain that, although I think you’ve told us an
extraordinarily ingenious story, I don’t think it’s
worth forty pounds. . . . Hullo! What’s this
arriving?”</p>

<p>The taxi from the garage had drawn up outside
the inn’s door, and was depositing some passengers
who had obviously come by the early morning train
from Pullford. They were not left in doubt for long;
the coffee-room door was opened, and, with “Don’t
get up, please” written all over his apologetic
features, the Bishop of Pullford walked in. Eames
followed behind him.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Bredon. I’m so sorry to
disturb you and your friends at breakfast like this.
But Mr. Eames here has been telling me about your
alarums and excursions last night, and I thought
probably there would be some tired brains this
morning. Also, I felt it was important to tell you all I
know, because of Mr. Brinkman’s hurried
departure.”</p>

<p>Bredon hastily effected the necessary
introductions. “You know something, then, after all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t think I’ve been playing you
false, Mr. Bredon. The evidence I’m referring to
only came to hand last night. But such as it is, it’s
decisive; it proves that poor Mottram met his death
by suicide.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch24">

<h2>Chapter XXIV. <br/> Mottram’s Account of It All</h2>

<p>“Rapid adjustment of the mental
perspective,” said Mr. Pulteney, “is an invaluable
exercise, especially at my age. But I
confess there is a point at which the process becomes
confusing. Are we now to understand that Mr.
Brinkman, so far from being a murderer, is simply an
innocent man with a taste for motoring late at night?
I have no doubt there is a satisfactory explanation
of it all, but it looks to me as if there had been
an absence of straightforwardness on somebody’s
part.”</p>

<p>“Possibly on that of Mr. Eames,” said the Bishop.
“I have to confess, on his behalf, that he has been
concealing something, and to take the blame for his
conduct—if blame attaches to it—unreservedly upon
myself. However, I do not think that any earlier
disclosure could have helped forward the cause of
justice; and I have lost no time in putting it all
before you.”</p>

<p>“You mean that letter which was left about in
the gorge,” suggested Bredon, “addressed to the
Bishop of Pullford? With a confession of suicide
in it?”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Mr. Bredon, you seem to know as
much about it as I do myself! Well, that is the long
and short of it. When Mr. Eames was with you last
night, Mr. Leyland, he told you that he had followed
Brinkman along the gorge, and that Brinkman had
disappeared in a motor. He did not tell you that,
half way through the gorge, he saw Brinkman
leaping up under a ledge in the rock, as if to put
something on it or take something down from it. The
something which he was putting up or taking down
was, I make no doubt, the document which I now
hold in my hand. Mr. Eames found it after Brinkman
had left, and, seeing that it was addressed to me
with an intimation that it was private and
confidential, thought it best to carry it straight to me
without informing you of its existence. I
understood him to say that he did not mention its
existence to you, Mr. Bredon, either.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I,” put in Eames.</p>

<p>“How jolly of you, Mr. Eames,” said Angela.
“You can’t think what a lot of trouble we’ve been
having with my husband; he thinks he knows all
about the mystery, and he won’t tell us; isn’t it
odious of him? And I’m so glad to think that you
managed to keep him in the dark about something.”</p>

<p>“Not entirely,” protested Bredon. “Cast your eye
over that, Mr. Eames.” And a document was handed,
first to Eames, then to the rest of the company,
which certainly seemed to make Eames’s caution
unnecessary. It was a plain scrap of paper, scrawled
over in pencil with the handwriting of a man who is
travelling at thirty-five miles an hour over bumpy
roads in a badly sprung car. All it said was, “Make
Eames shew you what he found in the gorge. I
thought it was you. F. Brinkman.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Bishop. “Brinkman, it seemed,
had some doubt as to the fate of a document which
got into the hands of the Catholic authorities. Poor
fellow, he was always rather bitter about it.
However, here we are, Mr. Bredon, owning up like good
boys. It was to put that very document into your
hands that I came down this morning. But I think
Mr. Eames was quite right in holding that the
document, with such a superscription, ought to be
handed over to me direct, without any mention even
of its existence to a third party.”</p>

<p>“I for one,” put in Leyland, “applaud his action.
I do not believe in all these posthumous revelations;
I prefer to respect the confidence of the dead. But I
understand that Your Lordship is prepared to let
us see the contents of the letter after all?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I think poor Mottram’s last directions
were influenced simply by consideration for my own
feelings in the matter. I have no hesitation myself
in making it public. Shall I read it here and now?”</p>

<p>In deference to a chorus of assent, the Bishop
took out the enclosure of the envelope and prepared
to read. “I ought to say by way of preface,” he
explained, “that I knew poor Mottram’s handwriting
well enough, and I feel fully convinced that this is
a genuine autograph of his, not a forgery. You will
see why I mention that later on. This is how the
letter runs:</p>

<blockquote><div>

  <p class="salutation">“ ‘My dear Lord Bishop:</p>

  <p>“ ‘Pursuant to our conversation of Thursday
  evening last, it will be within your Lordship’s memory
  that upon that occasion I asserted the right of a man,
  in given circumstances, to take his own life,
  particularly when same was threatened by an incurable
  and painful disease. This I only mentioned casually,
  when illustrating the argument I was then trying to
  put forward, namely that the end justifies the means,
  even in a case where said means are bad, provided
  said ends are good. I note that your Lordship is of
  the contrary opinion, namely that said end does not
  justify said means. I am, however, confident that in
  a concrete case like the present your Lordship will
  be more open to conviction <i>re</i> this matter, as it is a
  case where I am acting to the best of my lights,
  which, your Lordship has often told me, is all that
  a man can do when in doubtful circumstances.</p>

  <p>“ ‘I regret to have to inform your Lordship that,
  interviewing recently a specialist in London <i>re</i> my
  health, said specialist informed me that I was
  suffering from an incurable disease. I have not the skill
  to write the name of it; and as it is of an unusual
  nature, maybe it would not interest your Lordship to
  know it. The specialist was, however, of the decided
  opinion that I could not survive more than two years
  or thereabouts; and that in the interim the disease
  would give rise to considerable pain. It is therefore
  my intention, in pursuance of the line of argument
  which I have already done my best to explain to your
  Lordship, to take my own life, in circumstances
  which will be sufficiently public by the time this
  reaches you.</p>

  <p>“ ‘I have not, as your Lordship knows, any firm
  religious convictions. I believe that there is a future
  life of some kind, and that we shall all be judged
  according to our opportunities and the use we made
  of same. I believe that God is merciful, and will
  make allowances for the difficulties we had in
  knowing what was the right thing to do and in doing it.
  But I have been through some hard times, and maybe
  not always acted for the best. Being desirous,
  therefore, of making my peace with God, I have taken the
  liberty of devising some of the property of which I
  die possessed to your Lordship personally, to be used
  for the benefit of the diocese of Pullford. Said
  property consisting of the benefits accruing from the
  Euthanasia policy taken out by me with the
  Indescribable Insurance Company. And so have directed
  my lawyers in a will made by me recently.</p>

  <p>“ ‘I believe that your Lordship is a man of God,
  and anxious to do his best for his fellow-citizens in
  the town of Pullford. I believe that the money will
  serve a good end, although I do not agree with what
  your Lordship teaches. I feel sure that your Lordship
  will realize the desirability of keeping this letter
  private, and not letting it be known that I took my
  own life. The insurance company would probably
  refuse to pay the claim if I was supposed to have died
  by my own hand, that being their rule in such cases,
  except where the deceased was of unsound mind,
  which is not the case, me being in full possession of
  all my faculties. If, however, the preparations which
  I have made should eventuate successfully, it will not
  be supposed by the coroner’s jury that I took my own
  life, and the claim will be paid accordingly. Your
  Lordship will realize that this is only fair, since
  (1) in taking my own life I am only anticipating the
  decree of nature by a few months, and (2) the object
  to which I have devised the money is not the selfish
  enjoyment of a few persons, but the spiritual
  benefit of a large number, mostly poor. I am writing this,
  therefore, for your Lordship’s own eyes, and it has
  no need to be made public. I am quite sure that
  God will forgive me what I am doing if it is at all
  wrong, for I am afraid to suffer pain and am doing
  my best to bequeath my money in such a way that
  same will be used for good purposes. With every
  gratitude for the kindness I have always received at
  the Cathedral House, though not of the same
  religion, I remain,</p>

  <p class="valediction">“ ‘Your Lordship’s obedient servant,</p>
  <p class="signature">“ ‘J. Mottram.’ ”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>The Bishop’s voice quavered a little at certain
points in this recital; it was difficult not to be
affected by the laborious efforts of a pen untrained
in language to do justice to the writer’s friendly
intentions. “I’m very sorry indeed for the poor
fellow,” the Bishop said. “The older we grow, the more
tender we must become toward the strange vagaries
of the human conscience. That’s not the letter of a
man, whose mind is unhinged. And yet, what is one
to make of a conscience so strangely misformed?
However, I didn’t come here to talk about all that.
You’ll see for yourselves that, although the writer
<em>recommends</em> my keeping it dark, he places me under
no obligation to do so—he would have put me in an
uncommonly awkward position if he had. As it is,
I’ve had no hesitation in reading it to you, and shall
have no hesitation in producing it, if necessary,
before a court of law. It seems that our legacy, after
all, was only a castle in Spain.”</p>

<p>“The poor dear!” said Angela. “And it’s bad luck
on you, Mr. Leyland. Did you realize, My Lord,
that Mr. Leyland had just succeeded in persuading
us all that Mr. Brinkman had murdered Mr.
Mottram by letting in gas from the room above?”</p>

<p>“Well, thank God it was nothing as bad as that!”
said the Bishop. “At least this letter will help us
to take a kindlier view of him.”</p>

<p>“It would be a very singular and, I had almost
said, a diverting circumstance, if both things could
have happened at once,” said Mr. Pulteney, “if,
while Mottram was busy poisoning himself with his
own gas down below, Brinkman was at the same
moment, in complete ignorance, feeding him with an
extra supply of gas from above. It would be a
somewhat knotty problem, in that case, to decide whether
we were to call it suicide or murder. However,”
he added with a little bow to the Bishop, “we have
a competent authority with us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask me, sir,” protested the Bishop, “I
should have to consult my Canon Penitentiary. He
would tell me, I fancy, that the act of murder in this
case inflowed into the act of suicide, but I am not
sure that would help us much.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Eames, “Mr. Bredon could
tell us what view the Indescribable would take of
such a case.”</p>

<p>“They would be hard put to it,” said Bredon.
“Fortunately, there is no question of any such doubt
here. For Leyland’s suggestion of murder was only
based on the impossibility of suicide, in view of the
gas being turned off. Whereas Mr. Pulteney’s
ingenious suggestion has all the difficulties in it which
Leyland was trying to avoid.”</p>

<p>“I’m hanged if I can make head or tail of it,”
said Leyland. “It’s like a nightmare, this case;
every time you think you’ve found some solid ground
to rest on, it sinks under your feet. I shall begin to
believe in ghosts soon. And what are we to make
of the message itself? Might I see the envelope, My
Lord? . . . Thank you. Well, it’s clear that
Brinkman wasn’t putting the letter up on the ledge; he
was taking it down. It’s so weather-stained that it
must clearly have been there the best part of a week.
Now, why on earth was Brinkman so anxious to
take the letter away with him? For the letter proved
it was suicide, and that’s precisely what he wanted
to have proved.”</p>

<p>“Brinkman may not have known what was in the
letter,” suggested Eames.</p>

<p>“He may have thought the thousand pounds were
in it,” suggested Pulteney, “waiting there as a
surprise present for the Bishop. I am no acrobat
myself, but I believe I could jump pretty high if you
gave me that sum to aspire to.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Brinkman did know?” said
Leyland. “Of course if he did he was an accessory before
the fact to Mottram’s suicide. And that might make
him anxious for his own position—but it doesn’t
ring true, that idea.”</p>

<p>“Might I see the letter itself?” asked Bredon. “It
sounds impolite, I know; but I only want to look at
the way in which it’s written. . . . Thank you, My
Lord. . . . It’s rather a suggestive fact, isn’t it, that
this letter was copied?”</p>

<p>“Copied?” asked the Bishop. “How on earth can
you tell that?”</p>

<p>“I am comparing it in my mind’s eye with the
letter we found lying about in Mottram’s bedroom,
half-finished. Mottram wrote with difficulty; his
thoughts didn’t flow to his pen. Consequently, in that
letter to the <i>Pullford Examiner</i> you will find that
only the last sentence at the bottom of the page has
been blotted when the ink was wet. The rest of the
page had had time to dry naturally, while Mottram
was thinking of what to say next. But this letter of
yours, My Lord, has been written straight off, and
the blotting process becomes more and more marked
the further you get down the page. I say, therefore,
that Mottram had already composed the letter in
rough, and when he set down to this sheet of paper
he was copying it straight down.”</p>

<p>“You’re not suggesting that Brinkman dictated
the letter?” asked Leyland. “Of course that would
open up some interesting possibilities.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t thinking of that. I was only
thinking it was rather a cold-blooded way for a suicide
to write his last letter. But it’s a small point.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile,” said Leyland, “I suppose
you’re waiting for me to fork out those forty
pounds?”</p>

<p>“What!” said the Bishop, “you have a personal
interest in this, Mr. Bredon? Well, in any case you
have saved your company a larger sum than that.
I’m afraid you will have to write and tell them that
it was suicide, and the claim does not urge.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, My Lord,” said Bredon,
knocking out his pipe thoughtfully into the fireplace, “I’m
going to write to the company and tell them that
the claim has got to be paid, because Mottram met
his death by accident.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch25">

<h2>Chapter XXV. <br/> Bredon’s Account of It All</h2>

<p>“God bless my soul!” cried the Bishop, “you
don’t mean to say you’re preparing to
hush it up! Why, your moral theology
must be as bad as poor Mottram’s.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a question of theology,” replied Bredon,
“it’s a question of fact. I am going to write to the
Indescribable Company and tell them that Mottram
died by accident, because that happens to be the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Ah—h-h!” said Angela.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Mr. Eames.</p>

<p>“Not another mental perspective!” groaned Mr.
Pulteney.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what it is. I’m not a detective
really; I can’t sit down and think things out. I see
everything just as other people do, I share all their
bewilderment. But suddenly, when I’m thinking of
something quite different, a game of patience, for
example, I see the whole thing in a new mental
perspective. It’s like the optical illusion of the tumbling
cubes—you know, the pattern of cubes which looks
concave to the eye, and then, by a readjustment of
your mental focus, you suddenly see them as convex
instead. What produces that change? Why, you catch
sight of one particular angle in a new light, and
from that you get your new mental picture of the
whole pattern. Just so, one can stumble upon a new
mental perspective about a problem like this by
suddenly seeing one single fact in a new light. And
then the whole problem rearranges itself.”</p>

<p>“I am indebted to you for your lucid exposition,”
said Mr. Pulteney, “but even now the events of the
past week are not quite clear to me.”</p>

<p>“Miles, don’t be tiresome,” said Angela. “Start
right from the beginning, and don’t let’s have any
mystery-making.”</p>

<p>“All right. It would make a better story the other
way, but still—well, first you want to get some
picture of Mottram. I can only do it by guesswork,
but I should say this: He had an enormous amount
of money, and no heir whom he cared for. He was
a shrewd, rather grasping man, and he came to think
that everybody else was after his money. It’s not
uncommon with rich people—what you might call
the Chuzzlewit-complex. Am I right so far?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely right,” said the Bishop.</p>

<p>“Again, he was a man who loved a mystery for
its own sake, surprises, almost practical jokes. And
again, he was a vain man in some ways, caring
intensely what other people thought of him, and very
anxious to know what they thought of him. Also,
he had a high respect for the Catholic Church, or
at least for its representatives in Pullford.”</p>

<p>“All that’s true,” said Eames.</p>

<p>“Well, I think he really did mean to leave some
money to the Pullford Diocese. No, don’t interrupt;
that’s not as obvious as it sounds. He really did
mean to endow the diocese, and he disclosed his
intention to Brinkman. Brinkman, as we know, was
a real anti-clerical, and he protested violently.
Catholics were alike, he said, all the world over; the
apparent honesty of a man like Your Lordship was
only a blind. In reality Catholics, and especially
Catholic priests, were always hunting for money and
would do anything to get it—anything. At last
Mottram determined that he must settle the point for
himself. First of all, he went round to the Cathedral
house and defended the proposition that it was
lawful to do evil in order that good might come. He
wanted to see whether he would get any support
for that view in the abstract; he got none. Then he
decided, with Brinkman’s collaboration, on a
practical test. He would put Your Lordship’s honesty to
the proof.</p>

<p>“He went up to London, saw his solicitors, and
added a codicil to his will, leaving the benefits of the
Euthanasia policy to the Bishop of Pullford. I am
afraid it must be admitted that he did not, at the
time, mean that codicil to become operative. It was
part of his mystery. Then he went on to our people
at the Indescribable, and spun a cock-and-bull yarn
about seeing a specialist, who had told him that he
had only two more years to live. Actually he was in
robust health; he only invented this story and told
it to the Indescribable in order that, when it came
to the point, it might be reasonable (though not
necessary) to explain his death as suicide. Then he came,
back here and made preparations for his holiday.
He was going to take his holiday at Chilthorpe—to
be more accurate, he meant to start his holiday at
Chilthorpe. He strongly urged Your Lordship to
come down and share part of it with him; it was
essential to his plan.”</p>

<p>“And that,” suggested the Bishop, “explains his
intense eagerness that I should come down?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. He made certain, as best he could, that
you would arrive here on the morning after him;
that you would be told he had gone out to fish the
Long Pool, and that you would be asked to follow
him. This would ensure that you would be the first
witness of his disappearance.”</p>

<p>“His what?”</p>

<p>“His disappearance. He meant to disappear. Not
only for the sake of the test, I imagine; he wanted to
disappear for the fun of the thing; to see what
happened. He wanted to be a celebrity in the
newspapers. He wanted to read his own obituaries. That
was why he wrote, or rather got Brinkman to write,
a letter to the <i>Pullford Examiner</i>, calling him all
sorts of names—the letter was signed, of course, with
a pseudonym. You found that out, didn’t you,
Leyland?”</p>

<p>“Yes, confound it all, I heard only this morning
that ‘Brutus’ was really Brinkman. But I never saw
the point.”</p>

<p>“Then he sat down and wrote an unfinished letter
in answer to these charges. That letter, of course,
was to be found after his disappearance, and would
be published in thick type by the <i>Pullford Examiner</i>.
That would set everybody talking about him, and
his obituary notices would be lively reading. He
wanted to read them himself. But in order to do that
he must disappear.</p>

<p>“The Chilthorpe gorge is a good place to
disappear from. Leave your hat on the edge of it, and go
and hide somewhere—you will be reported the next
morning as a tragic accident. Mottram had made
all arrangements for hiding. He was going to spend
his holiday incognito somewhere; I think in Ireland,
but it may have been on the Continent. He was
going to take Brinkman with him. He would
disappear, of course, in his car. He had victualled it
before he left Pullford. On his arrival at Chilthorpe
his first act was to paint out its number-plate. He hid
some notes in the cushions of the car—that, I think,
was a mere instinct of secretiveness; there was no
need to do so.</p>

<p>“The plan, then, was this. On Tuesday morning,
early, Mottram was to set out for the gorge. Almost
immediately afterward, Brinkman was to take out
the motor, as if to go to Pullford. He was to pick up
Mottram, who would hide under the seat or disguise
himself or smuggle himself away somehow, and
drive like mad for the coast. Later, you, My Lord,
would come to the <i>Load of Mischief</i>, and would get
the message about going out to join Mottram at the
Long Pool. In passing through the gorge, you would
(I fancy) have found some traces there—Mottram’s
hat, for example, or his fishing-rod; and your first
thought would have been that the poor fellow had
slipped in. Then, looking round, you would find this
letter half-concealed on a high ledge. You would
read it, and you would think that Mottram had
committed suicide.</p>

<p>“And then—then you would either make the
contents of this letter public or you wouldn’t. If
Brinkman was right in his estimate, you would keep
the letter dark; the death, before long, would be
presumed. The Indescribable Company would have
been on the point of paying out the half-million
when—Mottram would have reappeared, and Your
Lordship would have been in a delicate position. If
Mottram was right in his view of your character,
then you would produce the letter; Mottram’s death
would be regarded as suicide, and the Indescribable
would refuse all claims. Then Mottram would have
reappeared, and would have seen to it that, in one
way or another, the Pullford Diocese should be
rewarded for the honesty of its Bishop.</p>

<p>“He was not really a very complete conspirator,
poor Mottram. He made three bad mistakes, as it
proved. Though indeed they would not have
mattered, or two of them would not have mattered, if
events had proceeded according to plan.</p>

<p>“In the first place, he went and wrote his name
in the visitors’ book immediately on arrival. He
wanted to leave no doubt that it was Jephthah
Mottram in person who arrived at the <i>Load of Mischief</i>
on Monday night. He wanted journalists to come
down here and look reverently at the great man’s
signature. Of course, in reality, it is a thing nobody ever
does on the night of arrival. It has made me
suspicious from the very first, as my wife will tell you.</p>

<p>“In the second place, when he took the precaution
of drawing up a new will he neglected to sign it
overnight. Brinkman, I suppose, pointed out to him that
if any fatal accident occurred—say a motor accident—the
codicil leaving the half-million to the Bishop
would be perfectly valid. To avoid this danger they
must have drawn up a new will, and if Mottram had
signed this overnight his death would have made it
valid. As it was, for some reason—probably because
Brinkman himself was drawing it up (I think the
writing is Brinkman’s) late on Monday night—the
will was never signed and was useless.</p>

<p>“In the third place, he did something overnight
which he ought to have left till the next morning.
He not only wrote his confidential letter to the
Bishop but he went out with Brinkman to the gorge
and posted it—put it on the ledge ready for the
Bishop to find next morning. He did not mean to go
into the gorge at all the next morning. He would
start out on the way to it, say, at eight, and at ten
minutes past eight Brinkman, driving the car, would
pick him up on the road. From the side of the road
they could throw over Mottram’s hat, possibly, and
they could slide his rod down the rocks, so as to
make it appear that he had been there. (Brinkman,
in this way, would establish an alibi; he could not be
supposed to have murdered Mottram in the gorge.)
But it was not safe to let the letter drop in this
casual way; therefore the letter must be planted out
overnight. There was no great danger of its
premature discovery; in any case, Mottram put it rather
out of sight on a ledge so high up that only a tall
man would see it, and only if he was looking about
him carefully.</p>

<p>“That is the complicated part of this business; the
rest of it depends on two simple accidents. Mottram
went to bed rather early; he was in an excited frame
of mind, and determined to steady himself with a
sleeping draught. The watch, the studs, were only
symptoms of that fussiness we all feel on the eve of
a great adventure. I suppose he borrowed a match
from Brinkman to light his gas with. But it was a
clear night; there was no need of light to go to bed
by. But just at the last moment—a fateful moment
for himself—he did light the gas; perhaps he wanted
to read a page or two of his novel before turning in.</p>

<p>“The rest of the story could be more easily told
upstairs. I wonder if you would mind all coming
up into the actual room? It makes it so much easier
to construct the scene if you are on the spot.”</p>

<p>The whole party applauded this decision. “This is
what is called an object-lesson, in the education of
the young,” observed Mr. Pulteney. “The young like
it; they are in a position to hack one another’s shins
when the teacher’s back is turned.”</p>

<p>When they reached the bedroom, Bredon found
himself falling into the attitude of a lecturer. “The
guide,” murmured Angela, “taking a party round
the ruins of the old dungeon. Scene of the ’orrible
crime. Please pay attention, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“You see how the gas works in here,” began
Bredon. “There’s the main tap, we’ll call it A, which
controls the whole supply. Tap B is for the bracket;
tap C leads through the tube to the standard lamp.
It doesn’t matter leaving tap B or tap C on as long
as tap A is turned off.</p>

<p>“When Mottram went up to bed, tap B and tap
C were both open, but tap A was properly turned
off. Mottram took no particular notice of the
disposition of taps; he turned on one tap at random,
tap A. Then he lit his match, and put it to the
bracket, which naturally lit. He then immediately
threw the match away. We know that, because we
found the match, and it was hardly burned down the
stalk at all. Meanwhile, of course, he had also
allowed the gas to escape through the tube into the
standard lamp; it never occurred to him to light
this. The standard was at the other end of the room,
close to the open window; the slight escape of gas
did not, unfortunately for him, offend his nostrils.
Brinkman told me, and it is probably true, that
Mottram had not a very keen sense of smell. After
a minute or two, feeling ready to go to sleep, he
went up to the taps again, and forgot to reverse the
process he had gone through before. Instead of
turning off the main tap, A, he carelessly turned off tap
B. And the light on the bracket obediently went out.</p>

Its handle is horizontal, and it is labelled “turned on.”" src="images/taps1.png" id="img_images_taps1.png"/>

</figure>

<p>“That is the lesson of a finger-print. Tap A was
stiff, and Mottram left a mark when he turned it
on; he would have left another if he had turned it
off. He did not; he turned off tap B, which works at
a mere touch, and of course he left no mark in
doing so. There, then, lies Mottram; the sleeping
draught has already taken effect; the wind gets up,
and blows the window to; tap A is still open, and
tap C is still open; and through the burner of the
standard lamp the acetylene is pouring into the
room.</p>

<p>“Brinkman is not a late sleeper. The Boots, who
is the earliest riser in this establishment, tells me
that Brinkman was always awake when he went
round for the shoes. On Tuesday morning Brinkman
must have woken early, to be greeted by a smell of
gas. It may have crept in through his window, or
even come up through the floor, for the floors here
are full of cracks. Once he had satisfied himself that
the escape was not in his own room, he must have
thought of the room below. When he reached the
lower passage, the increasing smell of gas left him in
no doubt. He knocked at Mottram’s door, got no
answer, and rushed in, going straight across and
opening the window so as to get some air. Then he
had time to turn round and see what was on the
bed. There was no doubt that he was too late to
help.”</p>

<p>“Did he know it was accident?” asked Eames.
“Or did he think it was suicide?”</p>

<p>“I think he must have known it was accident.
And now, consider his position. Here was Mottram,
dead by accident. There up in London was
Mottram’s codicil, willing half a million to the Diocese of
Pullford. And that codicil had not been meant to
become operative. It had been made only for the
purposes of the test. And now, through this accident,
the codicil, which did not represent Mottram’s real
wishes, had suddenly become valid. It would
certainly be judged valid, unless—unless the claim were
dismissed owing to a verdict of suicide. Brinkman
may or may not have been a good man; he was
certainly a good secretary. Put yourself in his
position, Mr. Eames. He could only give effect to his
dead master’s real wishes by pretending that his
dead master had committed suicide.</p>

<p>“You remember the remark in ‘The Importance of
Being Earnest,’ that to lose one parent may be an
accident, to lose both looks like carelessness? So it
was with Mottram and the taps. Two taps turned on
meant, and would be understood to mean, an
accident. But, and this is worth remembering, if all three
taps were found on, it would look like suicide.
Brinkman acted on the spur of the moment; he was in a
hurry, for the atmosphere of the room was still
deadly. He wrapped his handkerchief round his
fingers, so as to leave no mark, then, in his confusion,
he turned the wrong tap! He meant to turn tap B
on; instead, he turned tap A off. That sounds
impossible, I know. But you will notice that whereas
tap A and tap B are turned off when they are at the
horizontal, tap C is turned off when it is at the
vertical, When Brinkman, then, saw the three taps, B
and C were both horizontal, and A was vertical, it
was natural, in the flurry of the moment, for him to
imagine that if all three taps were in the same
position (that is, all horizontal) they would all be turned
on. Instinctively, then, he turned tap A from the
vertical to the horizontal. And in doing so he left
the whole three in the same position in which they
were before Mottram lit his match. No gas was
escaping at all. The result of Brinkman’s action was
not to corroborate the theory of suicide, but to
introduce a quite new theory—that of murder.
Half-stifled, he rushed from the room, locked the door on
the outside, and took the key away with him up to
his room.”</p>

<p>“Steady on,” put in Angela, “why did he lock the
door?”</p>

<p>“It may have been only so as to keep the room
private till he had thought the thing out, and the
Boots may have come round too soon for him. Or,
more probably, it was another deliberate effort to
encourage the idea of suicide. Anyhow, his actions
from that moment onward were perfectly
clear-headed. He helped to break down the door, and,
while Ferrers was examining the gas, while the Boots
was lighting a match, he thrust the key in on the
inner side of the door. It was only when he had done
this, when he thought that he had made the suicide
theory an absolute certainty, that he was suddenly
confronted with the horrible mistake he had made
in turning the wrong tap. It was a bad moment for
him, but fortunately one which excused a certain
display of emotion.”</p>

<p>“And he thought he would be run in for the
murder?” asked Leyland.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. But your arrival worried him
badly; you got hold of the murder idea from the
start.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he skip, then? There was the car,
all ready provisioned.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is that Brinkman is, according to his
lights, an honest man. And he hated the idea of the
Euthanasia money going to the Bishop. I was a
godsend to him; here was a nice, stupid man, briefed to
defend the thesis of suicide. As soon as I came, he
tried to take me out for a walk in the gorge.”</p>

<p>“Why in the gorge?” asked the Bishop.</p>

<p>“So that I should find the letter. Yesterday he did
manage to take me to the gorge, and actually drew
my attention to the ledge. I saw a bit of paper there,
but it never occurred to me to wonder what it was.
Poor Brinkman! He must have thought me an ass!”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t he get the letter himself, and
bring it to us? Or leave it lying about?”</p>

<p>“That was the maddening thing, the poor little
man just couldn’t reach it. The wind of Monday
night had blown it a bit further away, I suspect. Of
course, he could have gone out with a step-ladder, or
rolled stones up to stand on. But, you see, you were
watching him, and I’m pretty sure he knew you were
watching him. He thought it best to lead us on,
lead me on rather, and make me find out the
envelope for myself. When he’d drawn me right across
the trail of it, and I’d failed to see it, he was in
despair. He decided that he must bolt after all. It
was too horrible a position to be here under
observation, and fearing arrest at any moment. If he
were arrested, you see, he must either tell a lie, and
land himself in suspicion, or tell the truth, and see
the Euthanasia money fall into Catholic hands.</p>

<p>“He ordered a car from the garage to meet the
train which arrives at Chilthorpe at 8.40. He
determined to meet it on the way to the station. I
don’t think the thought of the car lying at the
garage, with the ‘sangwiches’—I mean the sandwiches—and
the whisky on board, occurred to him for a
moment. He is an honest man. But on his way to
meet the car he would go through the gorge, and
make sure that he was followed; he would draw
attention to the document, and then disappear from
the scene. He had not much luggage; he had only
to clear up a few papers, mostly belonging to
Mottram. Among these was the unsigned will which had
been drawn up, ready for Mottram’s signature, on
the Monday night. This he burned; it could be no
use to anybody now. He burned it standing at the
window, and the last, unburnt piece escaped from his
fingers, and fluttered down through a second window
into the room below—this room, which had been
Mottram’s. That was your find, Leyland. And the
odd thing is that it was through this absurd detail
that I got onto the track of the whole thing; because
one of my patience cards fluttered down through
a ground-floor window; and as I was carrying it
upstairs I realized that was how the scrap of paper
came to be lying about in Mottram’s room. Then I
began wondering what the will was, and why
Brinkman should have been burning it, and suddenly the
whole truth began to sketch itself in my mind, just
as I’ve been telling it you.</p>

<p>“Brinkman had bad luck to the last. I dropped
that card just after he started out with his
despatch-box; he saw that I’d disappeared from the window,
and supposed, with delight, that I was following him.
With delight, for of course I was the one man who
was interested in proving the death to be suicide.
He went back to the cache in the gorge, leading me
(as he supposed) all the way; then he waited for a
flash of lightning, and jumped up so as to draw
attention to the envelope. As he came down again
he looked round, and, in the last rays of the
lightning flash, saw that it was Eames, not I, who was
following him. Eames—the one man who would
certainly make away with the precious document! But
there was no time to be lost; he could hear the taxi
already on the hill. He ran round to the road, leaped
on board the taxi, and, in desperation, sent a note
to me by the taxi-man telling me to make Eames
shew me what he had found. I don’t know where
Brinkman is now, but I rather hope he gets clear.”</p>

<p>“Amen to that,” said Leyland; “it would be
uncommonly awkward for us if we found him. What
on earth could we charge him with? You can’t hang
a man for turning the wrong gas-tap by mistake.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Simmonds will be relieved about this,”
said Angela.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the Bishop, “I hear that
Mottram did leave some unsettled estate after all, and
that, I suppose, will go to Simmonds. Not a great
deal, but it’s enough for him to marry on.”</p>

<p>Angela swears that at this point she heard, on
the other side of the door, a scuffle and the rustle of
departing footsteps. She says you can’t cure maids
of their bad habits, really.</p>

<p>“My own difficulty,” said the Bishop, “is about
my moral claim to this money. For it was left to me,
it seems, by a will which the testator did not mean
to take effect.”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, you’ve earned it, My Lord,”
suggested Bredon. “After all, poor Mottram was
only waiting to find out whether you would prove
to be an honest man or not. And I think you’ve come
out of the test very well. Besides, you can’t refuse
the legacy; it’s in trust for the diocese. I hope
Pullford will see a lot of Catholic activity now.”</p>

<p>“The church collections will be beginning to fall
off almost at once,” said Eames, with a melancholy
face.</p>

<p>“I wish I had scrutinized those motor-cushions
more closely,” said Mr. Pulteney. “It seems to me
that I get nothing out of all this.”</p>

<p>“Which reminds me,” said Leyland, “I suppose
the bet’s off.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Bredon,” added the Bishop, “will get
no thanks from his company. I’m afraid, Mr.
Bredon, you will have carried nothing away with you
from your visit to these parts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” said Bredon.</p>
